B07LF84VVR,what in the name of hell is on your head arriving to work slightly hungover and in bad need of coffee then mccarthy ignored the question from his brother riley then had forgotten to buy coffee again and had gone without this morning living alone sucked before his dad and reilly moved out one of them had bought the coffee now he had to do it and he never remembered until he woke up late and realized he'd forgotten again riley wasn't giving up hello what is what fin choked back a yawn and tried to remember if he'd brushed his teeth before he left the house he had hadn't he wryly stepped closer to him boasting the freshly fucked look that had made finn want to stab him more than once in the months since his brother moved in with nicky that reilly pointed to the top of finn's head what is that finn had no idea what he was talking about until he reached up and encountered the lump of hair he'd secured with a rubber band to keep it out of his face their cousin shane joined them it's a man bun and it looks ridiculous riley that asshole busted up laughing what the hell is a man bun that shane pointed to finn's head is a man bun they're all the rage riley couldn't stop laughing he laughed so hard he howled while finn prayed that his cousin mac would bring coffee the way he did most days thankfully mac walked into the wayfarer a minute later with his business partner luke harris right behind him and was that a tray of coffee mac was carrying yes what's so funny then has a man bun shane said and it looks ridiculous riley added finn stole one of the coffees and took a big sip pure bliss there's nowhere to get it cut out here go see chloe at the curl up and die mack said i don't get my haircut in salons finn said disdainfully i go to barbershops and there isn't one on the island the way i see it riley said if it's a choice between a man bun or a salon i'm choosing the salon every time the way i see it finn said no one asked you wait till dad uncle mac and uncle frank see the man ben reilly started laughing again i gotta get a picture so we can show them in case they miss it the bastard whipped his phone out and had the picture before finn could react or turn away that picture would haunt him for the rest of his life maybe the guys were right a salon was preferable to putting up with this bullshit his hair had gotten so long it was either restrain it or wear a hat to keep it out of his face hats annoyed him when he was working so he'd grabbed a rubber band to contain it without a thought as to what it might look like apparently that had been a mistake today they were finishing up the shingling on the exterior of the wayfarer which was due to open in a couple of weeks they were on track to meet the aggressive deadline mac had set for the project and had turned the interior over to nikki the general manager she and the team she'd hired of the last few months would be loading in furniture this week week setting up hotel rooms and the dining room hanging wall art and making finishing touches ahead of the grand opening on memorial day weekend on saturday of that weekend the wayfair would host it's first major event the wedding reception of shane and his fiance katie lowery they joked that they were the guinea pigs to test out whether the mccarthy family's latest scans that island business venture was ready for prime time the day after the wedding finn's famous cousin evan mccarthy would headline the outdoor stage at the grand opening to the public so far the wayfair was a huge hit with nikki reporting that the hotel was sold out for the summer and ten other weddings were already booked that was what they wanted to hear each family member had stake in the business some bigger than others but everyone had put something into his uncle big mac's latest venture so they could all be owners finn was proud of the work they'd done to bring the old place back to life and even prouder of being part of something the family had done together before going outside to get to work then slathered sunscreen all over his face neck and arms gathered his nail gun and a ladder and followed the others to the scaffolding that was set up on the north side of the huge building they'd spent the winter renovating they'd done a damn good job if he said so himself,1
0008322651,it's meals on silver trays we went there to meet the french relatives because that is where they like to go on holiday from their homes in paris albeit rarely with one another even though i was only five at the time my memories of this holiday are clearer than of ones i took in my teens and twenties partly this is from the novelty of being outside of america for the first time and the experience was as jarringly formative as the first day of school or my first job but it's also because my family takes so many photos and more photos were taken of this holiday than of most people's weddings mainly by the family photographers my grandmother's brother henri and my father we are also a family of anecdotal lists and it is impossible for me to separate now when i actually remember about this trip and what i remember from the photos and stories told afterwards am i remembering actual memories or are they memories of memories in my family the line between the two is not always clear but everything i have written here about this trip has been corroborated by those wise enough to make this distinction better than me my parents in other words on our first night in deauville we arranged to meet everyone at the front of the hotel dining room before dinner i assume that my french family would turn out to be like my american one and i'd be running up and down the beach with my new relatives the way i ran around cincinnati with my cousins because in my five years of experience that's what extended families were like but when we arrived in the dining room a group of impossibly old people was waiting for us none of whom looked predisposed to run anywhere only two of them could speak english alex mcgee and sonya the rest just smiled and nodded at me and i gripping my mother's hand shyly did the same back to reveal it turned out was nothing like cincinnati so it was with some relief that i saw my grandmother arriving the last of the group at least i knew her and she spoke english but instead of joining us she hung back watching her siblings and cousins just as i was about to go over to her i noticed something i'd never seen before she was crying and then she turned around and rushed out of the room what's wrong with grandma i asked my mother but she shook her head at me and held her finger to her lips i looked up at my father for an answer but he was looking towards where his mother had disappeared and went after her alex mcgee whose real surname was glass like henri and sonya as well as my grandmother originally and it didn't occur to me to ask why he'd apparently changed it had a cabana on the beach and my parents that i could use it to change in and out of my swimsuit having one's own cabana seemed to me the absolute pinnacle of cool but that was before i saw at alex ornstein head on the beach his one giant umbrella red with a blue flag on top and every day we would all meet under it for lunch attended to by smartly dressed waiters even though his alex ornstein umbrella alex mcgee dominated those lunches he was small bold and tough like a bullet but he loved talking with my father as well as his cousin alex ornstein who he occasionally embraced fondly he didn't give hugs to my sister or me but he seemed to enjoy talking with us telling us about the famous artists he knew none of whom we'd ever heard of because we were respectively three and five years old when i got lost on the beach one day it was alex mcgee and his cabana i looked for b because i knew he'd know how to get me home like my grandmother sonia was short and had red hair but where salah was thin quiet and melancholic sonya was a solid ball of vibrating energy with her bright hair pink lipstick and blue eyeshadow she looked like a firecracker she taught my sister and me how to play bridge and introduced us to panel showcaller which was even more exciting than bridge in the morning she would meet us in the hotel lobby and walk us onto the beach where she seemed to know every person on the boardwalk who is that i asked once after she'd had a long involved conversation with an older american lady about their respective dogs i have no idea she replied marching onwards sonya's husband henri was at six foot about a foot taller than his wife and siblings but gentler than them and at eighty three still strikingly handsome he would catch my eye across the table and make apologetic smiles for not being able to speak english and he would often hold my grandmother stroking her hair like she was still his baby sister when sonia and al six mcgee argued viciously over lunch henri would just sit back letting it blow over we all knew you shouldn't get between a firecracker and a bullet alex ammonia ornstein where the fray list and in many ways the easiest going members of the group often acting as peace brokers between sonja and alex mcgee being in ornstein seemed to be less complicated than being a glass despite obvious differences from cincinnati i had a wonderful holiday i was introduced to french culture essentials such as triple scoop ice cream cones and begets but the grown ups occasionally seemed to be grumpy especially sonja and alex mcgee,0

B00BYGAVR6,mary took a deep breath inhaling air that was cleaner than any she'd ever breathed before this was a good place to make a life for herself she couldn't fail here she knew it this tiny little dot of land in the middle of wyoming was the most beautiful spot she'd ever seen and how could it be anything but good she shifted the bag she had slung over her shoulder and started along the trail that cut through the grass regardless of how much she loved providence failure wasn't an option at this point anyway she was thirty years old she'd been floating through life like a bit of dandelion fluff on the wind oh she'd touched down occasionally held jobs for a year or two bank teller sales support blackjack dealer dog walker she'd even gone to school to learn to do hair but the only good thing that had come out of that that had been her friendship with grace she was a jack of all trades and while she hadn't mastered anything she was a hard worker she wasn't lazy she wasn't dumb even if her cousins had given her the nickname the mary slacker a few years before even if when her mom had bought a new condo she'd cautiously explained to mary that it only had one bedroom so she wouldn't be able to take mary in again that had hurt mary had moved in with her mom for a few months once but that had been for years before what are you talking about she'd huffed trying to hide her injury with irritation why would you even say that i just thought you should know sweetie i won't be much of a safety net anymore a safety net as if mary were a circus performer with a terrible track record okay maybe she'd also moved home a few times after college but those had been short stays and yes she lived life one day at a time unlike her cousins who were both attractive driven and financially successful family gatherings were a little painful but mary could deal with it what she could couldn't deal with was her newly hatched self doubt hell her mom had always been a free spirit and now it seemed even she was expressing concern squinting against the bright morning sun mary stepped over a tall purple wildflower she could never bring herself to step on despite that it was smack in the middle of the trail over the past year what had started as a niggling worry had steadily grown into an irritation a grain of sand beneath her skin slowly the minerals of anxiety and fear had begun to accumulate around it just above her breastbone pressing displacing now it was like a stone she i could feel every time she swallowed she'd always been happy and she'd always assumed that someday she'd stumble onto that one good thing the job that made work into a passion the love that transformed her single life into something bursting with joy it hadn't happened because things like that didn't happen she decided that attitude would only buy her more years of floating over life mindless and untethered tossed about content to be lost not any more not this time not in providence,1

B00AADL1L4,thirty years later the phone rang i put down my red pencil and picked it up what i don't like to be interrupted my neighbors have the good sense and better matters not to bother me when i'm working worst i get during the day is little tommy olson knocking quietly on the front door then equally quick sadly going away that's why i have my phone under my real name the phone company won't let you do anything else but keep it unlisted i don't use my real name much particularly in my business it's a source of much idle amusement by people who are far too easily idly amused it's also the way i try to avoid getting stopped for speeding all cops have senses of humor but almost all of them seem to have stupid senses of humor there was a long pause on the other end and i thought about hanging up people have no manners you'd think that when somebody got a wrong number the first thing they do would be to apologize or if they didn't have the ordinary decency to do that they just hang up mr hemingway she sounded black yes i know voices have no color but people do and she sounded black and young two strikes against her in this world yes i just let it hang there ernest hemingway not the ernest hemingway he's dead he stuck his father's shotgun in his mouth and blew his brains out before you were born don't let anybody tell you there's no value to a classical education yes my name is ernest hemingway what do you want it was her turn to pause my father said i should call you i would have hung up on her i don't happen to have any black friends i don't in fact have many friends at all and i certainly couldn't recall any friend black or otherwise with a teenage daughter but while i hate to be interrupted when working i hate getting back to work even more what i do for a living is varied dull when it's not irritating but it pays the bills which i guess makes me an ordinary sort of guy after all my father is george washington bubble washington nicole he said you used to call him pres as far as i can tell the personnel division of the department of the army was filled with practical jokers whoever found four guys with famous names and put them in the same company probably got an oak leaf cluster for his creative assignment badge i'm not sure whether captain black ended up putting the four of us in the same tank for the humor value he never did seem to have much of a sense of humor war because he wanted to put all his bad apples in one metal barrel but it amounted to the same thing i leaned back in my chair and took a sip of coffee from the i love my mommy mug that i bought at a garage sale in the spring it was cold and bitter instead of hot and bitter i like hot and bitter better how is pres when you get to be my age you usually don't like the answer to that question but it has to be asked usually it's he died of cancer last year or he had a heart attack or he killed himself or some other equally jovial response he's dead mr hemingway they shot him i guess i could have asked her who they were but i didn't would make much of a difference anyway it certainly wouldn't have made any difference to press him being dead no so i asked anyway they who were they bangers bangers gangbangers crips and the police police sheer and he said you should call me yes he said that if anything ever happened to him i should call you and what did he say you should do when you called me just tell me that he's dead or do you have something else on your mind you have to be so me little girl you don't begin to know the first thing about what i do and don't have to be there was a quiet sound of crying on the other end of the line i sipped some more coffee it hadn't gotten any warmer it had been a decade since i had made a woman cry when jennifer had left she had left mad and dry eyed and it didn't feel any different a combination of a distant pleasure that i actually had an effect on another human being and a sense of disgust with myself that this was the only effect i could have on anybody else she hung up leaving me alone with my cloudy and distant pleasure and my clear and present disgust,0

B0157ANH16,the young soldiers were infuriated that our house had not raised a white flag and that we were having a meeting which they thought had been called together to conspire against them they questioned us why haven't you raised a white flag my father said we did not know we had to tie the flag up we thought we could each hold one in our hands indeed all the family had small white pieces of cloth tied to sticks to wave at passing soldiers what are you doing upstairs one of the soldiers queried as three of his comrades aim their weapons at us us are you having a meeting to destroy us while we liberate the city shaking in fear my father was at a loss for words but my uncle came to his rescue saying no we are playing cards and waiting to see what orders we are to receive from the new liberators we do not have plans to fight against the new front we knew if they search the house that like our neighbors we would all be gunned down on the spot because of the weapons hidden inside for a few minutes the young soldiers believed us and told the elders of my family to tie up a white flag on the gates they quickly changed the subject and asked us for directions to the olympic stadium where they were assigned to join up with other camaro rouge soldiers uncle sam on quickly said it is about five kilometers from here you just need to go straight and you won't miss the stadium at all upon hearing this the young soldier who had been speaking to us told his two comrades to arrest my uncle they immediately tied him up in front of all of us my whole family especially my mother was crying and shaking they knew that these young boys toting guns would kill my uncle somewhere along the road i stood silently in the midst of all this not knowing what to do as one though ing after another kept happening to our family my grandmother was also crying hard as they led away her son nobody knew what to do except beg the young soldiers not to hurt someone they escorted him out of the house and into the road as we were crying and begging expecting the worst no one in the family including my father knew what to think anymore thirty minutes later our neighbor mister kang on the same man who had offered to send me to new zealand with his children drove up in his volkswagen with his wife they stopped in front of the gates and spoke to father mister one asked if he wanted to come to the meeting with a camera rouge he wanted him to attend the peace talks and become a part of history after the incident at the school with the peasants having the b forties aimed at our house and the arrest of my uncle my father was quite content to stay at home and not be a part of anything even remotely political kong one was an extremely respectable man he was much like my father nice and quiet but very smart they look similar to both had fair skin and the same body type i remember many days when he would walk to our house in just a bathroom to shoot the breeze with my father talking about god knows what they were good friends but my father just didn't feel right about going to the meeting so he declined unbeknownst to us uncle sam one was taken in order to lead the way toward the olympic stadium for the young group of khmer rouge he walked in the middle of them and was made to carry one of their weapons on his shoulder as they weren't afraid have him using it with his hands tied my uncle was fearful for his life but there was nothing he could do except march along and lead the way for his captors after more than an hour of walking they finally reached the stadium and met with a larger group of camera rouge soldiers once they had reached their assigned position the commander ordered that my uncle be released they also gave him a permission slip allowing him to travel back through the city unharmed this was in gratitude for helping them reach their destination and was signed by the commander,0
B01FWNVZE4,in my neck of the woods there were three things you did in the summer you worked at a boring soggy job went to parties or hung out and watched illegal street races at least that's what the kids on the south side of town did and tonight was no different six days a a week forty hours a week i flipped burgers at reds mead neat stupid name but the hamburgers were awesome it wasn't my dream job but it paid decent money the real kicker was i got free food many nights i went home with hamburgers and fries sometimes a chocolate shake to some people might take that for granted but not me i went to bed most nights with a full stomach something i didn't do very often growing up so despite having a less than stellar job it was turning out to be a good summer at least it started that way i had put in a full day at the meet neat getting off in enough time to go out tonight there was a gathering of party goers at the old western plastics industrial plant he was in a deserted area of the city surrounded by empty roads perfect for drag racing and drifting just a few you have the illegal activities occurring around here weeds had taken over the broken pavement surrounding the building and there was more graffiti on the metal walls than there were windows but it was clear of cops and set far enough away from town that no one could hear the roar of the engines or the screeching of tires it was every street racers dream but i gotta say it wasn't mine i was here for something different something that would burst your eardrums and make you scream the music the abandoned plastics factory had been converted into a so called club by the owner's great grandson a year ago it was crewed and operated under the radar of government regulations or city ordinances i figured they knew about it but turn their heads not many people wanted to mess with the locals on this side of town and we were a nasty bunch and it took a real ball buster to deal with us i was here with my pseudo boyfriend lucas to hear dark paradox play they were a local hardcore punk band which wasn't my favorite type of music but he loved them so i tagged along lucas ryan was a year older than me and played bass with his own alternative rock band they made a name for themselves around here booked most weekends it didn't hurt that the band members were all gorgeous girl seemed to have a thing for guys who knew how to rock and carry a tune not me i hung out with lucas because i'd known him since high school we had recently started dating but before that we were only friends i glanced back as lucas and i wove our way through the sweaty dancing crowd he was following me keeping close enough that if i needed to i could reach out and grab his hand his dye black hair was long covering most of his face and hiding the tattoos that ran up his neck he had at least five earrings in one ear and wore nothing but black black shirt snug black jeans and black converses he was a social reject a misfit a black smudge on the face of society at least that's what the other kids in school had said his dad was a doctor who sampled his own medicine too often and his mother was a stay at home mom who was more concerned about her nails and hair than lucas but at least he had both parents i only had one and she was high or drunk most of the time at nineteen i was also a misfit i considered myself withdrawn and misunderstood i had few friends and even fewer reasons to smile i would rather get lost in an edgar allan poe book than watch the latest reality tv show like other kids my age i never or attended sleepovers or sat around and giggled with girls from school stephen king and anne rice were my best friends telling me stories that made my own life seem innocent and sweet i was afraid to get close to anyone because if i did they would leave,1
B00QSNAQVG,it is the lord and i will continue praying and he continued praying and the helicopter went away and the water continued rising and it rose to the point that went over his head drowned him and washed him to his death and after he died he went to heaven and the first person he saw was god and he said god he says i spent all my time praying to you and giving all my faith in you and it seems you let me down and god says gee i could swear i sent two boats and a helicopter and i am here today to be your helicopter whatever you may have thought about marketing whatever apprehension you may have had about marketing i am here to be your helicopter i'm here to carry you to safety in the marketing jungles starting out by talking about what marketing is in the first place and what marketing is is any contact from any member of your company with any member of the public marketing is not necessarily a formalized process where you put it in writing and the marketing people do it to customers marketing is something that includes every bit of contact the way your telephone is answered the way your office looks the kind of car you drive anything to do with you has to do with marketing if it has any impact on your customers and that means that everybody in your company is part of your marketing team so marketing is far more broad than most people think how is guerilla marketing different from standard marketing there are now fifteen differences between guerilla marketing and traditional marketing first you should know that ma marketing when it's healthiest it becomes a circle the circle begins with your idea for how you're going to generate revenue for your business and your life and the circle becomes a full circle once you have the blessing patronage of repeat and referral customers only when marketing is a circle that is a start producing profits for you marketing is also a process it's not an event it's a process that takes a long period of time if you do it right you will learn from this program just how to do it right as i say guerilla marketing is different from traditional marketing and fifteen ways in traditional marketing the primary invest but you should make in order to make marketing work is money guerilla marketing says if you want to invest the money you can but you don't really have to because your primary investments should be time energy and imagination and the more time energy and imagination you're willing to invest of the marketing process the less money you'll have to invest a second difference is that trading shuttle marketing intimidates many people it's enshrouded by a mystique they're not sure if marketing includes sales they're not sure if marketing includes advertising and as a result marketing is enchanted by this mystery in this mystique that is traditional marketing in guerilla marketing the mystique is completely removed in this program you are will understand exactly what marketing is so that you are always in control of it and it is never in control of you a third difference is that traditional marketing has always been geared to big business guerilla marketing does not have anything against big business but it is geared very much to small business every word and every line and ever every page of every gorilla marketing book and every word i will say in this program you will see is geared to small business now many big businesses are copying the ideas of guerrilla marketing because they do work for large and medium sized businesses but the soul and the essence of rural marketing is oriented to small business or fourth differences that traditional marketing measures how well it's doing by how many sales it's making guerilla marketing says that's not a bad thing but that's the wrong number the only number that's really meaningful are your profits anybody can generate sales anybody could have a high response rate to an offer but it's difficult to generate increasing profits that go up every single the month and yet that's what guerilla marketing is all about and it asks you to focus on those profits because that's the number that always will be telling you the truth a fifth difference is that traditional marketing is based on judgement it's based on experience but judgment and experience ends up causing you to make guesses and guerrillas cannot offer four to engage in guesswork it's just too expensive so guerrilla marketing is based as much as possible upon psychology laws of human behavior for example we know that ninety percent of all purchase decisions are made in a person's unconscious mind we also know a slam dunk manner for accessing the unconscious mind and the way to do that is through repetition now put those two facts together the majority of purchase decisions are made of the unconscious mind and the way to access the unconscious mind is through repetition and once you understand that you can get a better feel for the whole process of marketing and this shows you how girls lean on psychology to eliminate any kind of guesswork a sixth big difference between traditional and guerilla marketing is that traditional marketing says that you should get,0
B010HENKNW,that shouldn't bother him either but somehow it rankled that he was so fascinated by mara enthralled enough by her that he stopped everything to watch her and she never even acknowledged him why is she crying she's always smiling pushing himself away from the building he followed her unable to resist the compulsion to chase after her selfishly hoping her unhappiness wasn't caused by his actions she shouldn't know yet it could be anything maybe she was just hormonal that happened to women right or perhaps her dog died tragic but animals did have short lifespans compared to humans and they did die he'd never had a pet but gerrard imagined losing a canine companion i would definitely make mara cry problem was mara didn't have a dog and her only close relative her mother had passed away a year ago it could still be anything some other reason he cursed himself for carrying his curiosity getting the better of him as he continued to trudge after her she disappeared from the boardwalk obviously making her way to the sandy deserted beach the weather was dismal and it had been raining all day long yeah there was a temporary break in the storms at the moment but all jared had to do was take one look at the sky and he could see the next one quickly moving into a sport the dark clouds were coming straight toward the small maine coastal town which was the primary reason most sane people were indoors right now the streets and beach were nearly deserted cursing his fascination with the curvy burnett he took a slug of his coffee from brew magic and headed for the boardwalk personally jared loved the darkness of the stormy day the crashing of thunder and the deluge of rain matching the agitating restlessness he felt inside himself he didn't much care if he acted like a prick most of the time he was better than trying to fake a happiness that didn't exist for him i wish i'd never left the peninsula and come into town i wish i had stayed indoors and dry like the tourists are doing today then i never would have seen her never would have known she was even upset since he was probably the worst cook in the world he'd driven from his home on the ames port peninsula into town to get something to eat just as he'd been heading back to his vehicle he'd stopped to stare across the street at morris store two very different odd compulsion struck him deep in his gut whenever he saw the monstrous old structure that was mauro ross's shop and home certainly he was drawn to the old residents because it was part of the sinclair history in a m-sport a house that had belonged to a sea captain who was his ancestor every time he looked at the home he wondered what it had looked like two hundred years ago hell he was an architect by education wasn't it normal to imagine seeing the rambling old structure as it had been in it's glory days jared could shake those feelings off because of his education and occupation he loved old houses in general the sense of history he felt when he was in near them understandable perhaps considering his background what really disconcerted him was his obsession with the building's occupant mara ross she helped me out a few times it's normal to feel a certain amount of gratitude right jared was bullshit in himself and he knew it there were a lot of people who had helped him research the sinclair history in the town of aim sports since he'd arrived there for a visit to his vacation house weeks ago intrigued because he'd never known just how entrenched the sinclair's had been in this community historically he'd sought information just for the hell of it in the beginning the more he learned the more he wanted to put all the puzzle pieces together of his family history although he was grateful to everyone who had helped him put the mystery of his aims port ancestors together he didn't feel any inexplicable pull toward a single one of them except her oblivious to the damage he was doing to his casual but expensive italian leather shoes jared left the boardwalk and went down the small inclined to the beach his feet sinking into the wet sand where the hell did she go,1

B002UZJL0S,the face of nicholas easter was slightly hidden by a display rack filled with slim cordless phones and he was looking not directly at the hidden camera but somewhere off to the left perhaps at a customer or perhaps at a counter where a group of kids hovered over the latest electronic games from asia though taken from a distance of forty yards by a man dodging rather heavy mall foot traffic the photo was clear and revealed a nice face clean shaven with strong features and boyish good looks easter was twenty seven they knew that for a fact no eyeglasses no nose ring or weird haircut nothing to indicate he was one of the usual computer nerds and worked in the store at five bucks an hour is questionnaire said he'd been there for four months said also that he was a part time student though no record of enrollment had been found at any college within three hundred miles he was lying about this they were certain he had to be lying their intelligence was too good if the kid was a student they'd know where for how long what field of study how good were the grades or how bad they'd know he was a cl lurk in a computer hut in a mall nothing more or less maybe he planned to enroll somewhere maybe dropped out but still like the notion of referring to himself as a part time student maybe it made him feel better gave him a sense of purpose sounded good but he was not at this moment nor at any time in the recent past a student of any sort so could he be trusted this had been thrashed about the room twice already each time they came to easter's name on the master list and his face hit the screen it was a harmless lie they'd almost decided he didn't smoke the store had a strict non-smoking rule but he'd been seen not photographed eating a taco in the food garden with a coworker who smoked two cigarettes with her lemonade he still didn't seem to mind the smoke at least he wasn't an anti smoking zealot,0

B00RNF80FM,ashes to ashes dust to dust my mouth filled with saliva when i heard these words my eyes shaded by both sunglasses and a big black hat moving from the shining casket covered in a massive spray of deep red roses to the preacher standing at it's side i wanted to rise up from my chair snatch the words from the air and shove them down his throat this was an unusual reaction for me i wasn't like that but he was talking about gran gran my gran the gran whose body was in that casket she wasn't exactly young this was true i knew it was coming seeing as she was ninety three that didn't mean i wanted her to be gone i never wanted her to be gone outside of henry she was the only person i had the only person in this whole world ashes to ashes dust to dust grand wasn't dust my gran was everything on this thought i felt them coming and i couldn't stop them fortunately when they spilled over they were silent then again they always were the last time i let loose that kind of emotion was decades ago i never let it happen again i felt the wet crawling down my cheeks from under my sunglasses as i moved my eyes back to the casket i felt them drip off my jaw but i didn't lift a hand i wanted no one to notice the tears so i wouldn't give them any reason to do so not even movement on that thought i felt something else a strange prickling sensation of awareness gliding over my skin my eyes behind my sunglasses lifted and slid through the crowd standing around the casket they stopped when my sunglasses hit his and when they did my breath also stopped this was because in all my life and i'd had a long one and in all my wandering and i'd wandered far i'd never seen a man like him not once he was wearing a dark blue suit monochromatic shirt and monochromatic tie his clothes fit him well and suited him even better i knew this from experience not just liking clothes but also being on the fringe of the fashion world for the last twenty two years with a practiced eye i saw his suit was hugo boss which was a little surprising the small town where gran lived had some money in it and apparently that man was one of the people who added the surprising part was the rest of him didn't look hugo boss it definitely didn't look moneyed his black hair had a hint of silvery grey in it it was thick and clipped well but in a way that was not a nod to style instead it was apparent he didn't want to spend time on it so his style was wash and go even so it looked good on him he also had lines on his forehead and around his hard mouth that even hard still had lips that were so full they were almost puffy especially the lower one his sunglasses i was certain he had lines around his eyes these told me he was not a stranger to sun they also told me he wasn't a stranger to emotion he was tall broad and very big i'd been around a variety of men and women who had commanding presences henry being one of them but this man's wasn't that it wasn't commanding it was demanding strange but true and also somewhat startling,1

B002V5CRP8,yeah this problem and many said her talent was an inability to hide her feelings they were there up upfront shouting to anyone who cared to listen whatever she felt was mirrored in her grey eyes broadcast in the tilt of her head or the expression of her mouth some said that's what made her irresistible and dangerous with a flick of her wrist she turned the rearview mirror toward her yes she mused she could see the sparks of temper in her own eyes and the simmering resentment the dragging regret after all she and angela had been friends once or almost friends but she could also see the pleasure of anticipation that was a matter of pride this bout had been a long time coming smiling a little deanna took out a tube of lipstick and carefully painted her mouth you didn't go one on one with your arch rival without the most basic of shields pleased that her hat was rock steady she dropped the lipstick back into her purse climbed out of the car she stood a moment breathing in the balmy night while she asked herself one question calm deanna nope she thought what she was was revved if the energy was fueled by nerves it didn't matter slamming the car door behind her she strode across the lot she slipped her plastic id out of her pocket and punched it into the security slot beside the rear door seconds later a little green light flipped allowing her to depress the handle and pull the heavy door open she flicked the switch to light the stairway and let the door is shut behind her she found it interesting that angela hadn't arrived before her she'd have taken a car service deanna thought now that angela was settled in new york she no longer had a regular driver in chicago it surprise deanna that she hadn't seen a limo waiting in the light angela was always it's always on time it was one of the many things deanna respected about her the click of dns heels on the stairs echoed holly as she descended a level as she slipped her card in the next security slot she wondered briefly who angela had bribed threatened or seduced to gain entry to the studio not so many years before deanna had rushed down the same route wide eyed and those the attic running errands at the snap of angeles demanding fingers she'd been ready to preen like an eager puppy for any sign of approval but like any smart pup she'd learned and when betrayal had come with it's keen edged disillusionment she might have whimpered but she'd licked her wounds and had use to everything she'd learned until the student became the master it shouldn't have surprised her to discover how quickly old resentments long cooled could come rolling to a boil and this time deanna thought this time when she faced angela it would be on her own turf under her own rules the naive kid from kansas was more than ready to flex the muscles of realized ambitious then and perhaps once she did they would finally clear the air meet on equal terms if it wasn't possible to forget what had happened between them in the past it was always possible to accept and move on deanna slipped her card into the slot beside the studio doors the light blinked green she pushed inside into darkness the studio was empty that pleased her arriving first gave her one more advantage as a hostess escorting an unwelcome guest into her home and if home was where you grew from girl two woman where you learned and squabbled the studio was home smiling a little diana reached out in the dark for the switch that controlled a bank of overhead lights she thought she heard something some whisper that barely disturbed the air and a feeling stabbed through that fine sense of anticipation a feeling that she was not alone angela she thought and flicked the switch but as the overhead lights flashed on brighter ones blinding ones exploded inside her head as the pain ripped through them she plunged back into the dark she crawled back into consciousness moaning her head heavy with pain lolled back against a chair groggy disoriented she lifted a hand to the worst of the ache her fingers came away lightly smeared with blood she struggled to focus baffled to find herself sitting in her own chair on her own set had she mister q she wondered dizzy staring back at the camera where the red light gleamed but there was no studio audience beyond the camera no technicians working busily out of range though the lights flooded down with the familiar heat there was no,1
B07BQDH2LM,i feel him again that shadowless man who sneaks into my hospital room well after visiting hours extremely quiet as he closes the door behind him and makes himself comfortable in an uncomfortable stiff chair i can picture him now his eyes have an oddness to them squinted pinched and strained as he tries to capture my thoughts in the dark does he know they've consumed my life for days invaded them until all i can think about as i lie here is him i doubt very much he does if he did he would be smart to run i've been lying here for days trying to unscramble my thoughts these thoughts i've jokingly compared to scrambled eggs you beat them until they're broken pour them in a pan and fry them into little tiny kurds of fluff dump them on a plate and toss the remains in the garbage those are my thoughts those are my feelings and that that is indeed what this man sitting here has done to me so yeah he should run far away from me the first night he was here i woke to that stimulating smell that dragged me to him in the first place erotic sensual and earthy i can smell it now that all consuming scent of lavender sandalwood and jasmine it's too bad it's mixed with cruel ruthless and unkind jude westbrook is the carbon copy of a man who can in fact make a woman go completely unconscious to her way of thinking he makes you soar into the puffy white clouds with his charm his body his voice and those black rimmed glasses that make you want to weep a steady stream of desire from the inside out when he takes them off to show you the blue irises of his eyes eyes i became lost in smooth silky and warm he's a certifiable man with a smile he should patent every time he used that nipple tightening legs pressing together smile my brain through some kind of feel good party sparks flew close flew off and i had the best time of my entire life however the lips that produced that smile held a horrible message that possessed him to rip me open wide to bleed me out to make me sit back and think about what i had done foolish foolish girl he attracts women left right and center and he knows it takes advantage of it in a way only a man as shallow as he is knows how and any man who can make a woman feel as if she's worth nothing isn't a man at all regardless of his good looks his wit and his charm it didn't matter that some of the words he spoke made me breathless or left me thinking that whoever ends up capturing this good looking man's heart will be the luckiest woman in the world those romantic phrases he spoke all became dead end sentences when he chewed me up and spit me out as if i were poisoned in his mouth with the last words he said to me i know all of this to be true for the simple reason that i vivian shepherd went home with him for a night of pure passion it was the worst and best mistake of my life and he destroyed me with one hurtful sentence i painted him all wrong this cop who stole my breath an american hero who to me isn't a hero at all jude volume two the st series coming spring two thousand and eighteen,1
B01BH4LV5A,introduction you might have heard this story before once upon a time a grand old department store towered at the heart of daily live in a classic downtown environment shopping there became a tradition for generations of local residents the town's yearly calendar revolved around the stores sales and special events it said it's sounds smells textures and flavors were inextricably woven into the memories and dreamscapes of thousands of shoppers and then it died as people move to the suburbs the center of the retail trade went with them business became more precarious such that the company could no longer withstand a shock like a financial setback or a natural disaster and one day it was all over this same story has played out again and again in towns and cities across the united states name of city and some one who live there were still does will tell you about a great old store they loved and lost it's all part of the giant wave of demographic and economic change this swept through the country in the mid to late twentieth century johnstown pennsylvania has it's own version of this story one that doesn't seem so different on the surface from all the rest the penn traffic department store operated in johnstown for one hundred twenty three years generation tons of erie residents shopped at the store making it the center of their lives in a multitude of ways but by the mid nineteen seventies population shifts and changes in shopping habits took a toll business pulled away from downtown johnstown weakening the store and a mass massive flood in nineteen seventy seven delivered the death blow the store died end of story sounds the same as what happened elsewhere doesn't it but the details that matter most are so much different because the truth is no other store anywhere was quite like penn traffic in downtown johnstown ask anyone who shop there and they'll tell you penn traffic's dresses were cut up above the rest you'll never find a finer men's suit prepare shoes then you could find in that store the hats lingerie furs jewelry perfume and cosmetics were all top of the line and the food there hasn't been anything like it since the penn traffic bakery made the best pies cookies pastries fresh breads and rolls the restaurant on the first floor of penn traffic served the most delicious breakfasts lunches dinners and desserts you've ever tasted and could any candy past or present ever measure up to the glorious penn way candies handmade on marble slabs by elite craftspeople in the famous candy kitchen speaking of employees penn traffic had some of the friendliest and most helpful you could imagine they provided world class service guiding and supporting shoppers as if they were all members of the same family they celebrated our triumphs shared our losses and always helped us find exactly what we were looking for whenever we entered the store it was some of those very employees all these years after the stores closing in nineteen seventy seven who helped bring it back to life for this book it was their stories and photos and artifacts that brought back the magic we all love so well and miss so dearly we owe them i'm a debt of gratitude these faithful keepers of the flame without them countless details would have been lost forever the full story of penn traffic would have faded into history and future generations would have been denied an important part of their heritage now at least those gen operations will be able to see what they missed out on they'll be able to learn about the store that meant so much to so many for so long they'll be able to share our memories of what made penn traffic special and carry forward the best parts of it's legacy into the future the hopes and dreams that came to live within it's walls those of all the goods and services provided by penn traffic or perhaps it's greatest gifts,0
B07BB5CZ7V,dunkin are you just getting in jody asked and as much as he would have loved to tell the obviously pregnant woman shifting anxiously in the foyer from one dainty foot to the other while she wrapped her arms around her belly that he swore had grown larger since he saw her yesterday morning as she shifted another nervous glance over her shoulder that he was on his way out he just couldn't lie to her but god would he fucking love to be able to lie to her right about now yeah he said softly cringing when the effort to speak caused searing pain to shoot up and down his throat do you think that you could give me hand with danny she asked with a nervous little smile clearly embarrassed to have to ask him for help at three in the morning but that's why he was here wasn't it instead of speaking because dunkin wasn't sure that he could manage that without cursing in pain or starting another coughing fit that had him changing his mind and taking his lieutenant up on his offer to be seen in the emergency room and beg him to put him out of his fucking misery he couldn't wishing that he could do a lot of things differently he opened the door to the large laundry room that was off the back for your near the kitchen and quickly discarded everything saturated with smoke and soot until he was left standing there in his boxer shorts if this had been any other woman he would have never even considered stripping down in front of her but this was jody his roommate and an understanding woman who'd probably kill him with her dainty little hands if he wore a smoke saturated clothing to her house again the last time had been more than enough for him to get over his embarrassment and for her to get comfortable enough with him to threaten his balls if he ever made the house smell like it was on fire again not that he could blame her because he really couldn't there really was nothing quite like the sense of sweat ash and smoke filling the air after a fresh fire and giving a sister-in-law a whole new trigger for morning sickness to start the day off right moving in with his brother and sister-in-law had taken so i'm adjustment but so far they'd managed to survive the last month without killing each other which for any bradford was definite progress he just hadn't counted on being this fucking exhausted from doing it he worked three twenty four hour shifts most of that time was spent on the ring aig and the rest of the time he spent pulling ambulance duty which took a lot out of him it had also made him the perfect choice to move in and help his brother once danny had been able to return from florida and that fucked up side trip to las vegas that he had had to take before jody realized that she could probably do better and dump his ass,1
B07L5XWCXJ,the chapter two holy shit my sister claire called from los angeles the instant she heard the news he did what he took me to a bed and breakfast in sedona sat me down and gave me a teddy bear with a ring hidden in the gag that a right to hear me that ain't right i hear you but you know it's kevin my boyfriend scratch that my fiance had given me a stuffed animal for every major celebratory occasion since we'd started dating my junior year of college birthdays anniversaries christmases my closet was a veritable menagerie of plush penguins lions frogs and of course bears which would have been winsome had i been the kite of girl whose hobbies involved disney collectibles or a barbie's still sealed in their original boxes but i wasn't and i never had been my interests play more along the lines of flipping through australian vogue fabric shopping and ransacking flea markets for vintage dior pajamas i suppose he kept hoping that given sufficient exposure to guns i would start oohing and ahhing over the sorts of things he thought females should ooh and ahh over but so far nothing doing let me tell you a little story claire said i once dated a guy who had no money but was really fun and good looking this was when i was still young enough to have the luxury of dating poor people you understand when valentine's day rolls around would you like to know what mr perfect brought over to my apartment i sighed a teddy bear a teddy bear holding a cd and would you like to know what was on this cd i smile for the first time all day michael bolton songs worse it was a recording of him singing billy joel's she's always a woman wow yeah and you know what i did we said in unison dumped his sorry ass which was what claire had done to all her boyfriends until andrew king came along because along with looks charm and social connections out the ying yang he did have lots of money life is short my sister informed me i don't have time to date cheesy mc cheesed her mayor of cheeseball so what are you saying that i shouldn't have said yes part of me wanted to tell her about the despair that had been welling up inside me since i saw that ring shoved onto my finger the crying jags in the shower the loss of appetite this special celebrity weddings issue of people had induced hyperventilation i'd had to rummage through the kitchen drawers for an actual brown paper bag because now that you bring it up i have to tell you i'm having a few she cut me off i'm willing to let it slide this one time but only because it's kevin aka old faithful yeah my shoulders slumped i guess after years of dithering aimlessly through adolescence and early adulthood and then moving back in with my parents after college oh the shame i still didn't know exactly what i wanted out of life but i knew what i did not want to get married to kevin the problem was i had no concrete reason for this he didn't cheat on me didn't beat me didn't stay out all night gambling away the rent money at the craps table he was perfect husband material he wanted kids and already had significant retirement savings he had purpose and direction in life and everyone agreed i was a lucky to have someone like him to steer me along the path toward suburban prosperity but do you really think i'm ready to get married i asked of course you're ready to get married what else are you going to do with your life well what about my design career phoenix isn't exactly the next milan oh please she scoffed if you were going to do something with your sewing you would have done it by now i set my jaw and reminded myself that claire could not possibly appreciate the endless hours of research instruction and practice i'd endured in order to start making my own design patterns it is more than sewing my cutting and seams are practically up to couture standards i know that's why i decided to let you make my wedding dress let me you begged me and she'd been a pain in the ass about it too constantly changing her mind and demand,1
B0036GTJU2,he married amelia gottschalk the daughter of a jewish tailor and my father seemed to be hesitating was he wishing he'd never started the conversation eager to squash my enthusiastic curiosity was it all too embarrassing to talk about we know very little and it is only word of mouth he carried on with conviction then seemed to want to change the subject as quickly as possible as if i had now been told all i needed to know and there was no point in going any further except that this little pocket book is all there is why is this all there is i stroke the little book again i wasn't going to leave it at that what sixteen year old girl would be willing to dismiss the idea that she might be descended from a prince without coming up with a thousand new questions what about anna's mother what was her name schelotto my father said avoiding my eyes and those of my mother as he continued to eat his breakfast she was prince august's daughter well i said feeling slightly frustrated by how evasive they were both being there must be records of her life eve my father put up his hand to stop me in my tracks my mother gave me he stopped speaking for a moment as if mustering enough strength to keep his emotions under control in front of me and i immediately felt guilty for having forced him to talk about my grandmother anna like that anna was sending us letters intermittently vi the red cross which was in itself very worrying although she professed to be right i knew he was partly hoping that if she did get arrested then she wouldn't linger and would leave this earth before her suffering became too great while the other half struggled with the idea that he might never see her again would never be able to say goodbye and might never know the truth of what had happened to her in her final days my own deep rooted fears for her safety were distressing for me too as the truth of the desperate situation for all jews who remained in german occupied prague had begun to dawn on all of us we weren't alone in our worries many jewish families living in england had had to leave relatives behind for one reason or another when they fled from the murderous hatred that hitler was spreading throughout mainland europe in fact my family was more fortunate than many because my parents were already well traveled with many friends in other countries but anna had been too old and too slowed by her arthritis to be able to come with my uncle freddie my father's brother and his family when they escaped for the last time from prague to join us in england in nineteen thirty eight both uncle freddy and my father had had to put the welfare of their wives and children before that of their elderly mother especially as she was insistent that she wanted to stay they had done the right thing but that didn't mean my father wasn't wrapped with a painful guilt as a result tortured by not knowing what had happened or what could be happening in prague at the very moment that we were sitting around the breakfast table in england i went back to studying the precious little book in silence for a few moments this little book is all we have my father said after a few minutes it has been handed down through the generations it is the only proof we have that amelia and the prince had alive together and that that is where we came from when i am no more this book will be yours to keep and to pass on to the next generation but you mustn't do anything about it remember eve there is nothing more to find out nothing else has been written nothing else exists so don't go looking for it all we know is what we have learned by word of mouth apart from a little portray to have shallot as mother emilia which our uncle freddy has this book is all that exists from that time i wanted you to know that you have blue blood flowing in your veins that is all just be content with that in all my innocence i couldn't immediately accept what he was saying but i knew enough not to press him any more and i was privileged to think that i'd been chosen to be the keeper of such a precious and mysterious heirloom to be the one to pass the secret on to the next generation of our family i adored my father above anything else but he was sensitive and a man whose word i respected if he didn't want me to go looking for any more information about our family's past then i would not question his wishes any further my father passed the pocket book to my mother who promptly put it back into the old yellowing envelope it had come from and slipped the green ribbon over it then she left the room,0

B00BQLI0PY,it was nearly eleven thirty at night and still so hot that all i could think about was getting home my old volvo estate was stuck near highbury corner in traffic that shouldn't have been there at that hour and i could feel sweat trickling down my spine and sticking my new dress to my back no amount of dry cleaning was going to leave the fine flour silk the way it had been when we set out for hours earlier to celebrate barnabas his birthday my father his seventy fourth the pups were closing their customers spilling out across the pavements on the holloway road they must have been sweating and drinking iced beer all evening to a man or woman a figure wavered on the curb and my headlights shone for a moment on a blind sweating face i executed an instinctive swerve to avoid catastrophe beyond the pedestrian crossing at the station i rolled my window down hoping the movement of the car would bring in a stir of air but the heat had hammered down a lid of ozone and exhaust fumes over the city when it stung my nose crank the handle again a red light stopped me in front of the public library and i caught myself on the point of opening the window again all very well for me thirty three years old and tough enough but i wasn't alone in the baby seat beside me ben sprawled half naked drugged by the heat before the traffic had moved on i'd made up my mind absolutely positively for the twentieth time in a month that i was going to replace my beloved twenty year old car i wanted dust filters air conditioning all the gadgets that london's most astonishing infant could possibly need in this long summer he should have been at home of course i'd considered leaving him with his sitter except that barnabas would have been so understanding about his absence that it would have spoiled dinner for all of us if anything barnabas is even more daft about benjamin david hall than i am which is saying quite a lot the sky ahead had taken on a muddy darkness in which light flickered briefly there had been no rain in weeks but as i was signaling a turn off the main road a few oily drops hit the windscreen oozing through it's film of dust by george street they had already hesitated and stopped when i bought the new car i drive north for sure possibly to lapland heat sodden i squeezed into a space at the curb and dragged myself onto the pavement the ground floor of my early nineteenth century terraced house is the converted shop where i earn a living for ben and myself the gilt letters of the sign gleaned only in light from the streetlamp opposite dido hall antiquarian books and prints two doorways flanked the display window the one on the left was my immediate destination ninety seconds to get up to the flat a minute to settle ben in his cot under the open window in my bedroom say two minutes if he woke up in about four and a half minutes i intended to be naked and supine with a glass of a bottle of ice cold mineral water in my hand then sleeping face was tranquil in the night from the streetlight mp i am strapped the seat slid it out of the car and sweated across the road how could he possibly have gained so much weight in one evening the streetlight was throwing a deep shadow into the doorway so i was only a few feet away when i saw the shape there for one second i assumed that somebody had dumped a sack of rubbish on my doorstep then i saw a foot i had been presented with a body probably a drunk may be lying in wait my heart lodge she may be dead i backed off the obvious thing to do was retreat into the shop and phone the police from the back room getting myself to bed departed into the middle distance dammit caine was actually in the lock before my pathetic conscience took over so some poor homeless kid has dared to creep into your sacred doorway for a night's shelter and you're so ladylike that you're going to have him arrested london streets are full of the homeless nowadays a lot of them are any children if you really look at them you can't bear it i gathered the sweat trickling down my chin persuaded me that i only wanted to get the baby up the stairs to where they were damp towels cold drinks and bed as far as i could see the heap wasn't stay during i crept back to the foot braced for the stink of alcohol and then surprised by it's absence edged past the legs and reached gingerly to the door the light switch was just inside it and i knew him even though he was lying with his head under his bent arm and his face turned away from me with a sinking feeling i reached down and touched his shoulder for one heart-stopping moment there was no response then it seemed that he sagged and i heard the rasp of a difficult breath down a hole i deposited the sleeping baby just inside the street door mister ash nothing i touched his cheek and felt it's warmth under my palm and tried to think what to do,0

B07NDLRHTR,it is dangerous to awaken the lion the tiger's tooth is perishable but the most terrible of all the horrors that is man in his delusion friedrich schiller poet and thinker this book is about why we need alternatives in the most important area of our lives and what those alternatives might look like that area is living together with others our worst enemies have long since ceased to be natural disasters or predators other people have become the main threat the crucial quo question is therefore how we shaped the community with our fellow human beings humans are capable of agreeing on certain world views and even sacrifice their lives for them if those ideas are dubious or dangerous everyone else is endanger the only real problem with mankind is that people seek to impose their will on others the task is therefore to create an order which prevents this from happening the prevailing view in the west assumes that a combination of democracy and the rule of law is sufficient to combat the abuse of power and facilitate prosperous coexistence after the coup collapse of the communist eastern bloc some were even proclaiming the end of history liberal constitutional democracies were seen as the end point of development further progress no longer being possible soon all countries around the world would adopt this system this is a mistake however partly because of the fact that all our liberal democratic constitutions violate their own civil laws in that they are contracts to the detriment of third parties we will come back to this idea later our coexistence is also a market arrangement because it is subject to the same forces whether we like it or not a market is always present whenever and wherever people come together who are not yet completely satisfied every market is characterized by bringing together the supply and demand for for goods services and rights even if the majority of voters prefer an anti market economic system and politicians implement such a system this is a market result states also exist because there is a demand for them a state order creates a framework within which people can interact socially and exchange goods peacefully the existence of security and fixed rules makes it possible for large numbers of people to live together such coexistence is so attractive that people are willing to accept considerable restrictions on their personal freedom to enjoy it even the subjects of the most violent dictator will likely choose the status quo whoa over the life of robinson crusoe on a lonely island man is a herd animal the market of living together is not only the most important but also the largest market state activity accounts for approximately thirty per cent of the gross domestic product of all countries nonetheless yes the performance is poor the largest company in this market the united states of america shows losses of approximately one thousand billion dollars per year on its balance sheet some market participants such as sweden and germany intentionally attract unqualified new cusp dumars in need of alimentation and thus drive away their high paying regular customers some competitors such as iran or north korea even go so far as to kill their own customers for behavior that wouldn't even be considered punishable elsewhere any reasonably skilled entrepreneur should be able to do better if one could somehow offer the services of the state and at the same time avoid it's pitfalls more and more taxation and paternalism while constantly changing the rules of the game then a better product will have been created if the product is successful more people will want something similar new concepts will be necessary to get there of course if every new approach is rejected at the outset as a utopian pipe dream stagnation is likely to result the crux of past political utopias is that voluntary participation was never intended almost all of the classic utopian ideas are basically totalitarian starting with plato and his philosopher kings to marx's dictatorship of the proletariat and going right up to the current idea of a a great transformation because of climate change,0
B00FPTSNYQ,and pressure to perform actions we really shouldn't so in addition to developing your influence skills one important goal of this course is to give you information that will help you resist outside influence when it's in your best interests to do so because let's face it pin fluency is pervasive in our daily lives in fact research psychologist kevin dutton makes the claim that we are subjected to influence attempts somewhere near four hundred times a day four hundred and business author dan pink suggested in his latest book that we are always selling something even if it's just an idea now that might seem overstated but think back over yesterday how many conversations did you have where someone suggested a course of action to you why don't we eat there tonight or hey let's remodel the master bath or i'd like to get a second dog i had that last conversation a while back was convinced and spent weeks wiping messes off my floor then there's the steady bombardment of advertising if you count all those pop up ads that assail you whenever you browse the web these days than four hundred influence attempts might actually seem too low and what about politics i live in a state of iowa and we have candidates trying to convince us that they're qualified to be president of the united states for what seems like two full years leading up to the primers like it or not it seems that someone is always trying to persuade us to do something of course not every attempt at influence succeeds some of those iowa campaigns for example the speeches advertisements endorsements and rallies some of them really excite people and win votes but others fall completely flat why is that well we're going to spend a lot of time in this course examining the mechanisms that contribute to the success or failure of persuasion but first let's take a moment to pin down what we mean by success and failure in the first place if i'm trying to convince you to do something what are the possible outcome comms of my effort ask any management scour that question and she'll probably identify three possible outcomes conflict compliance and commitment the three c's if you've raised a child through adolescence and been told you are not the boss of me then you have encountered conflict conflict is when the target of your influence resists your ideas and even fights against you it is in fact a failure of influence successful influence on the other hand results in one of the other two outcomes compliance or commitment in our day to day interactions we often strive for commitment but will settle for compliance commitment means that people buy in completely and internalize what they're being convinced to believe with my own children i want them to clean their rooms and help with the dishes and would prefer that they commit to it that they do so cheerfully of their own free will but as we work towards that goal i will settle for compliance when i ask they do it many managers i work with feel the same way about their employees when it comes to customer service job safety and other desired work behaviors commitment is the ultimate goal but compliance at least means the employees are doing what they're asked when they are asked okay so now that we have a more precise way of talking about success and failure let's look at the factors that determine whether a particular influence attempt yields conflict compliance or commitment if you step back to think about an influence situation of political speech and small town iowa for example you'll quickly realize that there are quite a few moving pieces that could have an impact on the outcome to organize these pieces into a useful scheme we can identify four basic components that play a critical role first there's the politician then there's the content and delivery we have the speech itself next is the crowd and finally there's the setting then really the four components to contribute to the success or failure of this political speech can be detected in almost every influence attempt so let's give each of these four components a more general name,0
B072MNL68Y,maxine asks me early the next morning funny how natural it feels to resume the habits we shared three years ago like checking in first thing each day as i got on the stationary bike for spin at six thirty i rang him he picked up right away obviously already getting aerobic himself now i hesitate replying once maxon was the person i trusted most well as much as i trusted anyone i know now he didn't do me wrong and i utterly overreacted helion and i have talked a lot about trying to believe the best in people rather than assuming the worst she keeps telling me i have to take a leap of faith if i ever want to be happy trusting my own brother seems like a good place to start in learning at a jump besides iowan disastrously i fill him in on the reunion including the reason for britain's impromptu party what are you going to do is he really asking you this as if he doesn't have the same instincts what would you do well maxine pauses again healey's always telling me i should listen and empathize and let's be real here maxson sighs as if he hates to admit the truth if i had a son i wanted to know by a woman i was estranged from but figure out how to ingrain myself in every level of her life until i wore her down and she gave me what i wanted bingo i'll be calling an attorney to find out what my rights are and how to exercise them fully have already left him a voicemail i assure my brother i'd also be learning your schedule yet and plan to work on that today in fact i'll be quizzing you later every time i saw her i'd insist that i want to meet my son i not that goes without saying then i guess that's it if all you want is to have jamie in your the life he pauses but you want more you want the woman of course i do what would you do in that case when he hesitates i wince i probably had a sore spot i have no doubt he feels lost without kiely in your shoes i do everything humanly possible to separate britain from kyle i grin when i'm already thinking of a strategy but i'm trying to think less like a cutthroat bastard and more like a reasonable human being he says as he breezed through his run for keeley i get that i'm just not convinced that mister nice guy thing will work i'll try but i'm prepared to be more persuasive if she won't listen i think relentless might be a better term probably i walked out on beretta when she was pregnant it does the matter that i didn't know what she remembers is that i left her to give birth alone now i have to convince her how badly i want jamie also have to give her opportunities to see me as something other than the enemy when she's reassured of that start working with her on us i would prefer to claim both of them simultaneously she thinks she's marrying mikhail i have to change her mind and her heart on the other hand i know britta if i press her too hard too fast for something more than co-parenting shut me down she doesn't trust me at all i have to fix that and it will take time but i also can't let her believe i'm only back in her life for jane me sick which leads me to something i've been thinking you know for the duration of the sto contract i think you and i should work really closely together in fact we should work out of the same office maxon jumps on my train of thought a split second later and barks out a low laugh britta will hate my guts for agreeing to this but my brother does agree that's what's important right now i'll make her very happy in the end you can't walk away from her this time i'll kill you myself he vows that's absolutely the last thing on my mind i promise you so you really still have feelings were yes i don't have to think about it i know in fact i knew the second her eyes met last night whenever she once felt for me may have utterly changed but despite the years my parade of faceless flings i love britta i've always loved her and was too stubborn and too stupid to tell her when we were together for now i can only add that to my pile of regret we converted your former office into a storage and conference room but we could do without it for awhile i smile excellent you know she loves having a grandbaby so i saved my assistant she's been eager to visit her son and daughter-in-law in seattle i think she's earned some time off a month or two ought to do it and laughs of being in the same office with britta and of her being my assistant too agreed if i have her in my sights all day i can work on her slowly maybe we'll tackle projects and have lunch together i'll look for opportunities to see her after hours once i made jamie i will insist we do things as a family encourage her natural connection until she no longer has any interest in marrying another man and raising our son with him we just have to secure the listing first maxon points out in his shop about a thirty i'll go over the presure with you we'll figure out how to split it up then make our pitch at ten i think george and vivian stoll will be pleasantly surprised my hope since i fucked it up yesterday i definitely like to make them happy clients now perfect maybe you can aspirated helped me clear up my former office afterwards so i can move in again i could either i really hope it works out for you too thanks,1
B01AO3QA3S,virginia sat on the corner of the bed holding firmly to the post case a bit her lip she didn't really want to discuss her friend's private life with any one look it's kind of personal she's splitting up with her husband virginia's frown deepened into a grave disapproving scowl and she needs some support hard money yeah some virginia clucked her tongue that's the problem with your generation ready to throw in the towel at the littlest bump in a marriage casey couldn't stand the condemnation in her mother's eyes mom he hit her okay hard and he didn't stop there he slapped charlie to left a welt on his face oh so she needs a friend and i'm going to be at virginia's fingers twisted together virginia had suffered an abusive marriage in her own way casey had thought though she'd never spoken her mind on the subject jonah mackie had never struck his wife wife but he'd often belittled her and his string of mistresses have been legendary in the town case he had heard the snickering behind her mother's back seen virginia friends cover their mouth and smile at the knowledge that their husbands had been faithful while jonah mkiii had strayed virginia ever the loyal wife had turned a blind eye to her husband's marital lapses and raised her children without ever saying a word against her philandering husband of they'd all known how long will you be gone she asked as she plucked at a piece of lint on the quilt her mother-in-law maver said piece together i'm not sure casey replied i've been thinking ing it's time that i that you what i wish i knew but i really can't stay here and tread water i need to do something i need a purpose mom don't tell me this is some kind of mission to find yourself a real identity or something as trite as that casey snapped the suitcase closed right now this is a mission to help clarice after that who knows i'll call she promised as she swung her bag off the bed be careful always there mom casey had said with a wave she'd driven away from the ranch feeling free not even really paying attention to her mother's warning the same one virginia repeated every time any of her children left the ranch just a few miles out of dawson city casey's car had given out cursing the miserable piece of junk she had started walking through the snow barry and his beat up old pickup had stopped and offered her a lift and she'd been grateful that she wouldn't have to battle the wind and snow and a potential case of frostbite what she hadn't known was that he had a gun in the truck and as soon as she was settled in he grabbed her forced a pair of handcuffs on her and cuffed her to a handhold in the armrest then he trumped on the accelerator kept the pistol pointed squarely at her chest and warned her to stay put she had screamed yelled and cursed him alton no avail he seemed delighted to have captured her and she'd prayed it was all just a prank now of course she knew differently she had to escape but she couldn't not with her hands tied for the most part she was allowed to be unbound unless barry was sleeping or whenever he left to drive into town for supplies or to call his partner otherwise they seemed to think he could stop her if she tried to bold it wasn't in the best of shape but he was heavy and strong and though she was certain she could outrun him if all things were equal she couldn't slog through eighteen inches of snow and leave him in her dust besides where would she go today as if he sensed she was plotting a way to get out he tied her up again using rope instead of the handcuffs which had rendered useless when he clumsily dropped the key down a hole in the floor the last time he'd released her she mentally kicked herself for the thousandth time for getting into his truck then decided she'd had no choice choice as she couldn't have argued with a barrel of a gun she just had to make the best of it and find some way to escape just what is it you want she asked as barry took a long tug on his bottle then belched they'd been over this before but she hoped each time she asked she'd get to the bottom of her abduction and learned the identity of barry's silent partner a million big ones,1

B07QH3FJL6,why the single word fell into the silence as though weighted with bricks it barely even sounded like a question nigella jealous leaned forward fingertips braced on the edge of the dining room table in his elegant atlantic city mansion explain to me randomly what could conceivably have possessed you to take such an idiotic action and without so much as consulting me first i might add rennes le thorpe seven hundred year old vampire and part time white knight with a martyr complex looked up at his demon mentor he remained relaxed in his chair still wearing a mild expression but there was a dangerous glint hiding behind his a c b blue eyes people keep asking me that he said in his precise english accent and i keep wondering why something that seems so obvious to me appears to be so utterly opaque to everyone else rennes and i had arrived at night jealous his home some fifteen minutes ago luggage and hand admittedly that had been pretty brazen of us since we hadn't even called ahead to warn him we were coming also there was the small issue of rands having stolen a rare rare and powerful magic artifact from this house on his previous visit all in all i could understand nigella says frustration hell a part of me even shared it not so long ago i had snuck away from rans and followed my kidnapped father to the fei world of dane in hopes of protecting both of them the fe were after me because of my hybrid parentage and i was tired of other people being in constant danger simply because of their association with me at the time i'd understood that going to the fay realm put my life at serious risk but i chose to do it anyway whether it had been a good choice or a bad joyce was still something of an open question but rans had rendered moot by coming after me and hauling me back by the scruff of the neck maybe most women would find the idea of him swooping into the vague court like a dark avenging angel romantic and it was undeniably true that by doing so he'd saved me from execution yet i still found his eleventh hour rescue stomach churning more than anything because of what had happened next your actions have moved beyond recklessness and into blatant self destruction you bound your life to a mortals nigella says voice resonated like granite boulders grinding together i winced the magical artifact rans had stolen the last time he was here was a crystal not just any crystal mind you but a crystal that allegedly bound two people together so tightly that the death of one would instantly cause the death of the other working on what could only be called a hunch rands had barged into the fade cord and bound his life to mine in the presence of a cle election of the most powerful fe in dine he was the last vampire in existence after a magical weapon destroyed the rest of his race during the war between demons and fey he hadn't known for certain that his continued survival was one of the treaty provisions that had ended the conflict but he'd suspected it fortunately for both of us he'd been right and now that we were bound his centuries long life was doomed to end the moment my human one dead well i say human i acted to save a life that is important to me ran still didn't raise his voice neither did the spark of blue flame behind his eyes dim and if you're as smart as i believe you to be nigh jealous zora his life will become important to you too i cleared my throat awkwardly so apparently,1

B017MSS39W,and in whichever way he wanted which had everything to do with why he couldn't marry his former fiance tasha her failure to fulfill her role meant he needed to install someone else in her position and spin the breakup in his favor fast his father just wanted the rings and he was and picky about who camden gave them to after the way the press had framed his son the penthouse prince a playboy who'd sooner bring shame to the family than a wife and an heir his father hoped that marriage would bring a sense of respectability back to his son and the family so what if it was an illusion allusions were camden specialty seeing her so out of place in the room full of suits and having her notice he was tired when absolutely no one in his life seemed to see or perhaps dared to mention his exhaustion her instant of perceptiveness gave him a gut feeling and he he trusted his gut after all it had always been right even when his logical mind disagreed her clothes screamed working class enron and cheap nylons uncomfortable but functional black heels hair fluffy with untamed curls and her bottom lip he'd kill to taste her bottom lip just once but he knew what they'd agreed to as much as he wanted to kiss her touch her he'd have to control himself he needed to get her agreement preferably on paper that looked at least a little legal the chances of her digging too deeply into the legal these were slim to none but if she did nothing he could type up that fast would hold up in court for a minute but he'd been in a hurry enough that a quick agreement from her was all he needed they could finalize their agreement later make it official and legal her questions had surprised him usually if he threw enough money and perks at someone they agreed without thinking it through it made him feel a bit like the devil signing deals which leaned heavily in his favor painted with perks to blind his unwary competitors but she'd seen right through him he'd always ended up with women who fell for his games what a shame that the one woman who might be his match was only his fake fiance now as camden pulled her in for a kiss the shock on his father's face was priceless the man was used to determining value at a glance and he surely saw aw all that camden did in this woman working class average not the fiance of one of the richest men on this coast if not the country what surprised camden was genie's reaction apparently quick enough on the uptake to realize she couldn't pull away or she'd blow his story her hands lay only a little awkwardly on his chest and her mouth gave under his her tempting bottom lip moved and he couldn't resist a little nibble to test the feel of it the kiss felt more real from one breath to the next and his hold on her tightened the round the firmness of her breast pressed into his chest through her clothes hard points signaling her reaction when his tongue darted out seeking entry she opened her mouth allowing the angle of the kiss to slant into something more just the flavor of her was enough to leave his body the hard and hot tempting him to lengthen the embrace and enjoy the sweet nuances of her mouth his father cleared his throat and camden pulled back enough to meet her eyes green and verdant emerald like the hills of ireland captured in her gaze he licked his lips and waited expecting to see something on her face some sign of her feelings or her reaction to the kiss but she didn't move he wasn't willing to release her entirely not yet so he pulled her forward he leaned on the desk and placed her between his braced legs so he could twine his arms around her waist and the illusion of comfortable touching dead you didn't knock camden could we have a moment alone his fall father adjusted his tie his most obvious tell he was pissed so be it he named the game camden only played it out sorry dad maybe later genie just got in like i said and i've missed her were headed out maybe to do a little shopping ng and get some dinner i'll contact rachel get her to cancel my appointments for the day,1

B0874SQZ7N,the rhythm of sword fighting was an acquired taste that lie amaranth was still in the process of acquiring there was a flow to it back and forth offense paired with defense it was nothing like the aggression of wielding his dagger looking for that single quick well placed strike he danced back from jack's blade fighting old instincts as he saw the vampire's weapon dart upward and what he suspected was a feint he played it slow turning his own sword sideways in preparation to block the real attack the sudden vibration ran through lee's hands as jack reversed slashing from low to high and connecting their weapons in the middle he could feel the fatigue through his fingers and knuckles through a half dozen calluses and a healthy scattering of blisters he counterattacked sweeping his sword in an arc at hip level jack twisted his hands downward in an awkward but effective movement arresting the strike before it could land properly,0
B002V0152O,boiling point i was see then inside over the fact that someone would hate americans so much as to commit such a heinous crime then like so many americans i needed to deal with the nine eleven tragedy on my own home brought by lunchtime after i'd gotten over the initial shock of what had happened i focused my attention on mckenzie my three year old little girl i knew that what had just happened didn't mean anything to her and that she had no eyes idea what was going on at the time we lived just south of nashville international airport far enough from it that the noise didn't ever bother us but still within it's busy flight patterns when the winds came out of the north the aircraft flew high over our house on their approach to be in a a while little girl loved to watch the planes come over so that day i took her outside and went to the front yard where we could both clearly see the sky we lay down on our backs on a grassy knoll with the noonday sun beating down on our faces from a completely cloudless canopy i leaned over to mackenzie and said let's see how many airplanes we can count she was excited so we waited and we waited there were no planes no planes at all now you can keep a three euros interest for very long there are no planes she finally said and jumped up come on daddy let's go do something else i held mackenzie in my arms for a little while then i said to her look at me sweetheart and i want you to remember this there was a day when daddy took you outside to see the planes and there were no player planes flying anywhere in the sky no planes why daddy today the president said no one can fly planes today so there are none today's the only day this will happen you will never see this again i want you to remember what daddy showed you on the day there were no planes that was the only way i could impress upon a three year old the importance of that sad and terrible time chapter two service america minus the nine eleven attacks really made me think about my children and their future twenty years from now would they be free to pursue their everyday hopes and dreams without fear without worrying that semis evil person was going to plant a bomb in the mall or blow up an airliner where my children gonna have to exist in a country riddled with fear having to live in constant dread is like being forced back to the caveman days when every time you stepped outside you had to worry about whether a saber toothed tiger was gone h you before nine eleven i thought civilization had progressed beyond that point here with all his pent-up religious tension i'm not so sure anymore had i been president in september two thousand and one once we ascertained that islamic fundamentalists had committed this atrocity i would have demanded a conference call with every arab leader in the world listen if this is the first salvo the first shot and if this is going to continue then let it be known today that it will not continue for very long we have the fire power to end this and we're willing to use it my children and my grandchildren will not live in fear for the rest of their lives because that's not living that's just exist i would have put it all on the line i'm worn in new folks right now i'm willing to end it all i will incinerate this rock started with afghanistan and i mean it if you're not going to get with the terrorist eradication program and get your shit together and if you permit this stuff to go on in your own countries by god i will end this now we will all go to our maker and we'll let him decide who was right it would have been at that moment hopefully that some sensible person in my administration would have dropped a horse tranquilizer in my coffee the united states didn't ask to be the security force for the entire globe that roles being forced upon us because nobody else will stand up against the evil in this war that's right we're being forcibly put in a position of responsibility because of the apathy and negligence of other world leaders we didn't ask to be the world cup and the american people don't want that,0
B00W354Y98,who are your personal heroes okay maybe you don't have heroes exactly then let me ask you this which people do you admire most who do you wish you were more like what people fire you up and get your juices flowing do you admire business innovators such as sam walton fred smith or belga thats great athletes such as michael jordan tiger woods or mark mcguire creative geniuses such as pablo picasso buckminster fuller or wolfgang amadeus mozart pop culture icons such as marilyn monroe andy warhol or elvis presley spiritual leaders such as john wesley billy graham or mother teresa political leaders such as alexander the great charlemagne or winston churchill film industry giants such as dw griffith charlie chaplin or steven spiel berg architects and engineers such as frank lloyd wright the star at brothers or joseph strauss revolutionary thinkers such as marie curie thomas edison or albert einstein or maybe your list includes people in a field i didn't mention it's safe to say that we all admire achievers and we americans especially love pioneers and bold individualists people who fight alone despite the odds are opposition the settler who carves a place for himself in the wilds of the frontier the old west sheriff who resolutely faces an enemy in a gunfight the pilot who bravely flies solo across the atlantic ocean and the scientist who changes the world through the power of his mind the myth of the lone ranger as much as we admire solo achievement the truth is that no lone individual has done anything of value the belief that one person can do something great is a myth there are no real ram bows who can take on a hostile army by themselves even the lone ranger wasn't really lie boehner everywhere he went he rode with tonto nothing of significance was ever achieved by an individual acting alone look below the surface and you will find that all seemingly solo acts are really team efforts frontiersman daniel boone had companions from the transylvania company as he blazed the wilderness road sheriff wyatt earp had his two brothers and doc holliday looking out for him aviator charles lindbergh had the backing of nine businessmen from st louis and the services of the ryan aeronautical company which built his plane even albert einstein the scientist who revolutionized the world with his theory of relativity didn't work in a vacuum of the debt he owed to others for his work einstein once remarked many times a day i realize how much my own outer and inner life is built upon the labors of my fellow men both living and dead and how earnestly i must exert myself in order to give in return as much as i have received it's true true that the history of our country is marked by the accomplishments of many strong leaders and innovative individuals who took considerable risks but those people always were part of teams economists lester see thoreau commented on the subject there is nothing antithetical in american history culture or traditions to teamwork teams were important in america's history wagon trains conquered the west men working together on the assembly line in american industry conquered the world as such zestful national strategy and a lot of teamwork put an american on the moon first and thus far last but american mythology extols only the individual in america halls of fame exist for almost every conceivable activity but nowhere do americans raise monuments in praise of teamwork i must say that i don't agree with all of thoreau's conclusions after all i've seen the u s marine corps war memorial in washington d c commemorating the raising of the flag on iwo jima but he is right about something teamwork is and always has been essential to building this country and that statement can be made about every country around the world a chinese proverb states behind enable man there are always other able men and the truth is the teamwork is at the heart of great achievement,0
B0886JSBZK,the first thing carl noted was the mist and he shivered at the unexpected change in temperature that there was a mist was logical as this island was called the mister dial they told him the mist usually lifted by mid morning right now it was thick and heavy hiding anything a few feet away he did a quick assessment noting that he had physically changed he had been lean and strong before now he was muscular and taller with blonde hair that came to his shoulders his left hand held a buckler and in his right hand was his broadsword the question now was where was he and what was he supposed to do they told him he'd find out as the game progressed lifting his hand with a sword still in it he pressed a finger in the air calling up his stat screen locating the map icon he pressed it and found the little red flag indicating his location the island was in the shape of a key curved hand with the extended fingers as the starting promontory the bridge to the next island was on the opposite thumb side of the island what lay between was a series of rivers forests mountains and bogs he felt his stomach grumble knew he had to eat it had been me more than a day since his last meal studying the map he saw he was close to a town called mar back all he had to do now was orient the map and beyond his way which was impossible as the mist obscured everything sword and buckler at the ready coral slowly and cautiously made his way in the midst discovering that he he was on a well traveled dirt road which seemed odd as the map had him at the very edge of the island he was even more surprised when he nearly bumped into a large medieval looking gate of dark wood and iron hinges exploring to his left and right he learned that the wall surrounding the gate were made of smooth drab grey granted how high they rose was another matter as all he could feel when he tapped his sword as high as he could reach was stone returning to the gate he probed the solid wooden gates and after a minute of searching for an entry gave up banged on the door and called out low any one there were no reply came he pounded on the door with a pommel of his sword low anyone home he was about to pound again when a small sliding window scraped open and a pair of irritated gray eyes stared out why do you want the voice demanded it was a man's voice hoarse with age i am a traveler looking for a place to eat and rest go away come back when the mist is gone won't open the gate until then he grumbled then slid the window closed how long is that he banged on the gate again causing the window to jerk open i said go away gates won't open until the mist goes away how long is that how should i know do i look like a damned weather wizard what place is this the eyes glowered at him for a moment mar back yet damned fool now go away again the window slammed shut acknowledging that at least he knew where he was and accepting that he wasn't gaining entry until the mist cleared karl walked over to the side and sat down leaning against the stone wall his sword across his knees he then focused his senses penetrating into the surrounding mist he heard the pounding of the surf and wondered how high above the ocean the town lay and whether the view from the walls was invigorating and then he wondered who and how they were able to make this so lifelike he placed his hand against the stone wall and felt the cold solid resistance of hard rock it felt real just like this mist felt real was it his imagination dreaming this was he in some sort of suspended state with a phd read him dreams and situations making him believe it was all real if only he could have talked to someone who had been in the game and returned then he'd know for sure he didn't know how long it was but his legs were beginning to ache and he stretched them out noticing that the mist seemed brighter and parts of it began to dissipate enough so that he could make out more of the walls as well as the close cropped vegetation edging the road to his front,0
B00JPHY5Z0,he'd been forced to face her was it so very wrong of her to enjoy the moment she thought perhaps not she rested her hands flat on her thighs and looked at him how can i help you his dark gaze settled on her face really you're not going to admit you know what any of this is about out she blinked deliberately then opened her eyes wide when you made your appointment to speak with me you didn't mention a subject of course she knew why he was here but again a little emotional torture seemed the right kind of payback a muscle twitched and his jaw all right who will play this your way hi i'm sam ridge i'm a partner at score she grinned i know who you are sam we don't have to pretend that much just tell me what you want and we'll move on from there he swore under his breath you're friends with terran you've done work for her how long are you going to punish me me he was right about terran she and elina were friends and had worked together several times score the pr firm in question and move to fool's gold just after the first of the year three of the partners were former nfl players and terran was the glue that held the company together i haven't completely decided how long you should be punished she admitted wondering if batting her eyes again would be too over the top he sighed heavily fine we'll do this your way now that we've moved our business here my partners and i want to have a big party for our clients we've booked a hotel but that's as far as the planning has gotten a party she breathed and pressed her hand to her chest that sounds really nice in truth being a neurosurgeon or the person who used to land the space shuttle probably made the top ten list of jobs designed to give a person an ulcer sam would guess whoever was in charge of the ball dropping in times square on new year's eve probably had a few sleepless nights but he would add that that being a kicker for an nfl team had it's moments of stress when he'd been with the l a stallions he'd been responsible for twenty six wins including three during playoff games and one super bowl victory he knew what it was like to have everyone watching him both in person and on tv and have his job performance critiqued endlessly he'd always known the outcome the instant his foot connected with the ball and he was famous for turning away and letting the sounds from the crowd tell him if he was right he was used to pressure he'd lived it and breathed it but he'd never face down anyone like dolina hopkins before and the worst part about it was she was right to give them a hard time sam shook his head okay he said i give i was wrong her brown eyes twinkled wrong about what that night leaving the way i did it was just he motioned toward the hallway those dresses and that list whole of but i'm not looking to get married neither am i you're the one with a room full of wedding gowns her full lips pressed together sam tried not to notice but her mouth was one of the first things that had caught his attention back on valentine's day he'd been staying at ronan's la judge for a few weeks until escrow closed on his new place he'd gone down to the bar for a drink only to realize it was valentine's day and the place was crawling with couples as he'd recently sworn off women again he'd started to turn around to go back to his room but before he could safely escape he'd spa added de lena she'd been with friends name were laughing and talking no one had noticed him she'd been pretty enough but then she'd smiled and it was like getting kicked in the gut and he was a man who knew the power of a good kick he'd sent over a tray of drinks for the table they'd invited him to join join them and an hour later he and alina had been having dinner together later when he'd kissed her he'd discovered her mouth had been as exciting and intriguing as he'd hoped she'd invited him home he'd said yes and the rest had been incredible until we'd gotten up in the night and found himself in a nightmare he'd spent the past five months avoiding her tough to do in a town the size of fool's gold the situation had been complicated by the fact that he'd enjoyed her company and had really wanted to see her again now that his company needed her services he'd been forced to suck it up so here he was,1
B07F17ZJGD,don't always talk about the effects of history i'm so glad mine did my nine told me how her husband my gramps had almost fallen victim to hitler's wolf packs in the north atlantic as he escorted convoys back and forth to supply britain's food and war material her father had narrowly escaped a shell blast and glibly and nineteen fifteen her grandfather been dave avidly george britain's wartime prime minister he was party to decisions that change the world he laid the foundations for a welfare state in the uk threw his weight behind war with germany in nineteen fourteen agreed to the establishment of a jewish homeland in palestine shaped the versailles settlement and encourage the disastrous greek attack on turkey after the first war the war each decision had enormous often unimagined consequences many of which we are still living with it each began as a conversation a signature on a piece of paper a single moment on a particular day anniversaries offer a moment to take stock and remind ourselves that what we see in the present has its genesis in the past events do not spring from a vacuum they form and evolve over time and their present nature as a reflection of their histories it is deeply affecting to study the slaughter of the first day of the somme the sinking of the titanic or the cataclysmic great lisbon earthquake but it always feels different more immediate on the day of the year on which it happened throughout my career across television radio podcasts online video social media posts articles and books i have repeatedly seen anniversary stories go viral be shared by tens of thousands online and watched by millions the first program i ever made covered this sixtieth anniversary of the start of the battle of el alamein and when it was broadcast on the exact night in october when montgomery's heavy guns opened fire in the western desert it really struck a chord with the audience i've been very lucky to be president so many anniversary since i helped to drop a wreath from the deck of a british frigate into the choppy seas off cape trafalgar exactly two hundred years the hour since british french and spanish ships opened fire in that climactic naval battle i've stood on the somme battlefield at dawn looking at a landscape of rolling feet fields flecked with wild flowers one hundred years to the minute after one thousand whistles and an army of young men at their trenches i've watched galloping male clad horsemen charging up the slope at battle in sussex during a huge reenactment in two thousand and six with the largest number of people packed onto that field since the first battle of hastings exactly nine hundred and forty years before watching the events i've often asked myself why this particular date should drive us to engage with these moments in our past they remain just important relevant fascinating or tragic on any day of the year yet none of our street is a direct link that forces us to stop and acknowledge the past on the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month in nineteen eighteen the guns of europe fell silent after four years of the most bitter and devastating fighting the war to end all wars was finally over the armistice was signed at five am in a railway carriage in the forest of compiegne in france on november eleventh nineteen eighteen on the seventh of november nineteen nineteen george the fifth issued a proclamation calling for two minute silence where all locomotion should cease so that in perfect stillness the thoughts of everyone may be concentrated on reverent remembrance of the glorious dead now one hundred and years later a two minute silence is still observed throughout the country the formal end of the first world war is still marked lest we forget not just remember the appalling losses of that conflict but those who have been killed or injured in the line of duty ever since remembrance is something we should always be mindful of but we can't think about everything all the time and having a special day ensures that each year we will be reminded of our debt to those who fought on our behalf and obligations to those who continue to struggle with the consequences of war this book is my attempt to harness that connection and explore some of the most important and interesting moments from our past each entry gives a short precis of a day which continues to influence our present and future some like armistice day the ides of march you might have heard of some i hope will come as a surprise the day for instance the napoleon ran away from a group of rabbits showed that the great emperor's supposedly inexorable rise to power was stoppable whilst the second of august thirteen forty three when john cleese one became a pirate and singlehandedly declared war on the king of france is a vivid example that we don't have to be the victims of history we can choose to make our own each entry is the merest tip of the iceberg each page could be a book in it's own right and whole books have been written about each sometimes many i relish the opportunity while studying history university,0

B002V0PZI4,back in the decades since i'd observed the sclerotic build up of family photographs resentfully and i chafed at my mother's usurpation of my drawer and closet space and when she'd asked me to clear out my old boxes of books and papers i'd reacted like a housecat in whom she was trying to instill community spirit she seemed to she owned the place which of course she did this was the house where five days a month for ten months while my brothers and i were going about our coastal lives she'd come home alone from chemotherapy and crawled into bed the house from which a year after that in early june she'd called me in new york and said she was returning to the hospital for more exploratory surgery three and then had broken down in tears and apologized for being such a disappointment to everyone and giving us more bad news the houseware a week after her surgeon had shaken his head bitterly and sewn her abdomen back up she'd grilled her most trusted daughter in law on the idea of an afterlife and my sister-in-law had confessed that in point of sheer logistics the idea seemed to her pretty far fetched and my mother agreeing with her had then as it were put a check beside the item decide about afterlife and continued down her to do list in her usual pragmatic way addressing other tasks that her decision had rendered more urgent than ever such as invite best friends over one buy one and say goodbye to them forever this was the house from which on a saturday morning in july my brother bob had driven her to her hairdresser who is vietnamese and affordable and who greeted her with the words oh mrs fran mrs friend you look terrible and to which she'd returned an hour later to complete her makeover because she he was spending long hoarded frequent flyer miles on two first class tickets and first class travel was an occasion for looking her best which also translated into feeling her best she came down from her bedroom dressed for first class said goodbye to her sister who had travelled from new york to ensure that the house would not be empty when my mother walked away from it to say some one would be left behind and then went to the airport with my brother and flew to the pacific northwest for the rest of her life her house being a house was enough slower in its dying to be a zone of comfort to my mother who needed something larger than herself to hold onto but didn't believe in supernatural beings her house was the heavy but not infinitely heavy and sturdy but not everlasting god that she'd loved and served and been sustained by and my aunt had done a very smart thing by coming when she did but now we needed to put the place on the market in a hurry we were already a week into august and the house's best selling point the counterbalance to it's many defects it's tiny kitchen it's negligible backyard it's too small upstairs bathroom was it situation and the catholic school district attached to the church of mary queen of peace given the qual city of the webster groves public schools i didn't understand why a family would pay extra to live in this district in order to then pay further extra for schooling by nuns but there were a lot of things i didn't understand about being catholic according to my mother catholic parents from all over st louis eagerly awaited listings in the district and families in webster groves had been known to pull up stakes and move just one or two blocks to get inside it's boundaries unfortunately once the school year started three weeks from now young parents wouldn't be so eager i felt some additional pressure to help my brother tom the executor of the estate to finish his work quickly i felt a different kind of pressure from my other brother bob who had urged me to remember that we were talking about real money people knock seven hundred eighty two thousand dollars down to seven hundred seventy thousand dollars when they're negotiating they think it's basically the same number he told me well no in fact it's twelve thousand dollars less i dunno about you but i can think of a lot of things i'd rather do with twelve thousand dollars then give it to the stranger who's buying my house but the really serious pressure came from my mother who before she died had made it clear that there was no better way to honor her memory and validate the last decades of her life than to sell the house for a shocking amount of money counting had always been a comfort to her she wasn't a collector of anything except danish christmas china and mint plate blocks of us postage but she maintained lists of every trip she'd ever taken every country she'd set foot in every one of the quote wonderful exceptional european restaurants on quote she'd eaten in every operation she'd undergone and every insurable object in her house and her safe deposit box she was a founding member of a penny ante investment club called girl tycoons whose portfolios performance she tracked my newly in the last two years of her life as her prognosis worsened she'd paid particular attention to the sale the price of other houses in our neighborhood writing down their location and square footage on a sheet of paper marked real estate guide for listing property at eighty three webster woods she'd composed a sample advertisement the way somebody else might have drafted her own obituary two story solid brick three bedroom center hall colonial home unshaded lot on cul-de-sac on private street there are three bedrooms living room dining room with bay main floor den eat-in kitchen with new g e dishwasher etc there are two screened porches two wood-burning fireplaces two car attached garage security burglary and fire system hardwood floors throughout and divided basement at the bottom mm of the page below a list of new appliances and recent home repairs was her final guess about the houses worth nineteen ninety nine este value three hundred and fifty thousand dollars plus this figure was more than ten times what she and my father had paid for the place in nineteen sixty five the house not only constituted the bulk of her assets but was by far the most successful investment she'd ever made i wasn't a ten times happier person than my father her grandchildren weren't ten times better educated than she was what else in her life had done even half as well as real estate it'll sell the house my father had exclaimed after he built a little half bathroom im in our basement it'll sell the house my mother had said after she paid a contractor to redo our front walkway and brick she repeated the phrase so many times that my father lost his temper and began to enumerate the many improvements he'd made including the new half bathroom which she evidently thought would not sell the house he wandered away loud why he'd bothered working every weekend for so many years when all it took to sell the house was buying a new brick walkway he refused to have anything to do with the walkway leaving it to my mother to scrub the moss off the bricks and to chip away gently at the ice in winter but after he had spent half a month of sundays installing decorative molding as in the dining room mitering and spackling and painting he and she both stood and admired the finished work and said over and over with great satisfaction it'll sell the house it'll sell the house it'll sell the house long past midnight i turned off the lights downstairs and went up to my bedroom which tom and i had shared until he went away to college my aunt had done some cleaning before she went back to new york and i had now taken away all the family pictures and the bedroom looked ready to show to buyers the dresser tops and desktop were clear the grain of the carpeting was neatly scalloped from my aunts vacuuming of it the twin beds had a freshly made look and so i was startled when i peeled back my bedspread to find something on the mattress by my pillow and it was a bundle of postage stamps and little wax paper envelopes my mother's old collection of plate blog rx the bundle was so radiantly out of place here that the back of my neck began to tingle as if i might turn around and see my mother still standing in the doorway she was clearly the person who'd hidden the stamps she must have done it in july as she was getting ready to leave the house for the last time some years earlier when i'd asked her if i could have her old plate blocks she'd said i was welcome to whatever was left when she died and possibly she was afraid that bob who collected stamps would appropriate the bundle for himself or possibly she was just checking items off her to do list but she'd taken the envelopes from a drawer in the dining room and moved them upstairs to the one place i would most likely be the next person to disturb such micro-manage aerial presence the private message that the stamps represented the complicit wink in her bypassing of bob the signal arriving when the sender was dead it wasn't the intimate look that faye dunaway and warren beatty exchange and bonnie and clyde and instant before they're both shot dead dead but it was as close to intimate as my mom and i were going to get finding the bundle now was like hearing her say i'm paying attention to my details are you paying attention to yours the three realtors i interviewed the next day were as various as three suitors in a fairy tale the first was a straw haired shiny skinned woman from century twenty one for whom had appeared to be a struggle to say nice things about the house each room came as a fresh disappointment to her and her strongly cologne male associate they conferred in low voices about potential and additions my mother was a bartender his daughter who never finished college and her taste was what she liked to call traditional but it seemed to me unlikely that the other houses on century twenty one's list were decorated in substantially better taste i was annoyed by the real alters failure to be charmed by my mother's parisian watercolors the realtor however was comparing our quaint little kitchen with the hanger like spaces in newer houses if i won,0

B002V1O5AM,chapter fifteen marius and the senate i bought one the senatorial reaction grackles and furious flaccus having fallen and their movement being thereby left without a leader the senatorial counter attack could have free play after the battle of the seventeen the console leukemias condemned to death without trial three thousand democrats women when were even forbidden to make mourning for the dead and though many folk persisted in paying pious homage to graco says memory all open opposition was completely cowed when two years later the author of this hideous reprisal was impeached by a tribune before the centurion assembly his acquittal gave the endorsement of public opinion to the legitimacy of the senate's ultimate decree meanwhile steps were being taken to modify or in some cases to abolish the agrarian and colonial measures of the grackle regime in one twenty one bc the small holders settled under the land act were empowered to sell their plots and in consequence the bombs began to pass back into the hands of the big proprietors till it was said though doubtless with much exaggeration and that the lands of roman italy were vested in the ownership of no more than two thousand persons in one eighteen the land commission was dissolved and the allotment of small holdings thereby brought to an end finally in one eleven all those who still held aga public us on squatter tenancy were granted absolute possession free of rent or tithe in other words the states can claim upon such land was abandoned once for all future schemes of redistribution were therefore rendered impossible except by legitimate purchase or outright confiscation and the big aristocratic landowners good ones more feel themselves comparatively secure as for the colonial policy of gratis the year of his death must certainly have seen the cancellation of his carthaginian settlement but what is very remarkable is that in one eighteen as we saw in the previous chapter a trans marine colony of a commercial character was planned and the new province of transalpine goal this can only have been due to the influence of the knights whose interest in commercial undertakings must on this occasion have carried the day though we may shrewdly guess that some senators to whose money was invested with capitalist syndicates regarded the scheme with approval similar financial considerations may also serve partly to explain why no very vigorous attack was made on the new constitutional powers of the night it's four though about one eleven some attempt was on foot to repeal the grand jury law it came to nothing sudden alterations were made in judicial procedure but the nights monopoly of the panels was allowed to stand unchanged the senate counter attacked had proved in short a very mild affair the victory of one twenty two had restored to them indeed their old pre eminence but the very circumstances under which that victory had been won had given them a terrible fright and they simply did not dare to follow it up to it's logical conclusions by openly attacking either the powers of the assembly or of the knights or even of the tribunes yet things in rome were never the same again then the ultimate result of the dragon revolution was to leave weakened and discredited every political element within the state he had had shown that the senate's position was was not impregnable and the prestige of the order never recovered from the shock he had had given the assembly a new appetite for power and had simultaneously proved that the assembly was unworthy to wield it last but not least the use to which the tribunal had been put had broken the fine old tradition of magisterial harmony it opened opportunities for the dangerous self assertion of individual ambitions it taught tribunes to employ their prerogative a veto for fascists and anti social ends it encouraged demagogic appeals to the west instead links of the mob and so tended to produce in the holders of the office a complete bankruptcy of statesmanship though such men were often imply to fall where the interests of ambitious magnates the tribunal itself was never again a great independent power in politics and the real lie leaders of the future as we shall very soon see where to owe their influence not so much to the fact that they will magistrates as to the fact that they were military chiefs,0

this location the car continued it's giddy ascent passing one of several steel trestles that rose from the rocky crags he was unnerved and not simply from the crowded surroundings ghosts awaited him atop germany's highest peak he'd avoided this rendezvous eu for nearly four decades people like him who buried their past so determinedly should not help it from the grave so easily yet here he was doing exactly that vibrations slowed as the car entered then stopped at the summit station skiers flooded off toward another lift that would take them down to a high altitude corey where a chalet and slopes waited he didn't ski never had never wanted to he made his way through the visitor center identified by a yellow placard as mangia house a restaurant dominated one half of the building the rest housed a theater a snack bar an observatory souvenir shops and a weather station he pushed through thick glass doors and stepped out onto a railed terrace bracing alpine pine air stung his lips according to stephanie nelle his contact should be waiting on the observation deck one thing was obvious ten thousand feet in the high alps certainly added a heightened measure of privacy to their meeting the zugspitze lay on the border a succession of snowy crags rose south toward austria to the north spanned a soup bowl valley ringed by rock ribbed peaks a gauze of frosty mist shielded the german village of garmisch and it's companion partenkirchen both were sports meccas and the region k catered not only to skiing but also bob sledding skating and curling the more sports he'd avoided the observation deck was deserted save for an elderly couple and a few skiers who would apparently pause to enjoy the view he'd come to solve a mystery one that had preyed on his mind ever since that day when the men in uniforms came to tell his mother that her husband was dead contact was lost with the submarine forty eight hours ago we dispatched search and rescue ships to the north atlantic which have combed last known position wreckage was found six hours ago we waited to tell the families until we were sure there was no chance of survivors his mother had never cried not her way but that didn't mean she wasn't devastated years passed before questions formed in his teenage mind the government offered little explanation beyond official releases when he first joined the navy he tried to access the court of inquiries invest get a report on the sub sinking but learned it was classified he tried again after becoming a justice department agent possessed of a high security clearance no luck when gary his fifteen year old visited over the summer he'd faced new questions gary had never known his grandfather but the boy had wanted to know more about him and especially how he died the press had covered the sinking of the u s as blaze akin nov nineteen seventy one so they'd read many of the old accounts on the internet their talk had rekindled his own doubts enough that he had finally done something about them a plug changed balled fists into his parka and wandered the terrace telescopes dotted the railing at one stood a woman her dark hair tied in an unflattering ben she was dressed in a bright outfit skis and poles propped beside her studying the valley below he casually walked over one rule he'd learned long ago never hurry it only bred trouble quite a scene he said she turned certainly is her face was the color of cinnamon which combined with what he regarded as egyptian features in her mouth nose and eyes signaled some middle eastern ancestry i am cotton malone how did you know i was the one who came to meet you he motioned at the brown envelope lying at the base of the telescope apparently this is not a high pressure mission he smiled just running an errand something like that i was coming to ski a week off finally i always wanted to do it stephanie he asked if i could bring she motioned at the envelope that long she went back to reviewing you mind if i finish this it cost a euro and i want to see what's down there she revolved the telescope studying the german valley that stretched for miles below you have a name he asked jessica she said her eyes still to the eyepiece he reached for the envelope her boot blocked the way not yet stephanie said to make sure you understand that the two of you were even last year he'd helped out his old boss in france she told him then that she owed him a favor and that he should use it wisely and he had agreed dead paid return from the telescope wind reddened her cheeks i've heard about you at magellan billet a bit of a legend one of the original twelve agents i didn't realize i was so popular stephanie said you are modest too he wasn't in the mood for compliments the past awaited him could i have the fire her eyes sparked sure he retrieved the envelope the first thought that flashed through his mind was how something so thin might answer so many questions that must be important she said another lesson ignore what you don't want to answer,0

B005FG3IUI,wet path to her ear god i've been itching to touch you since i saw you in that damn shower this morning all naked and lathered up his words sent a shiver skittering along the surface of her skin leaving her tiny hair standing on end tugging on the hem of his sweater she bunched the soft fabric in her hands and shoved it up as she slid down with fingers she couldn't seem to move fast enough she popped the snap to his pants and drew the zipper down immensely satisfied with his quick in drawn breath his hands tightened in her hair apparently torn between wanting to push her away and yank her closer but settling for just touching her a tug on the open material and his erection sprang free from both his pants and briefs she laughed my my careful there you could put an eye out with that thing he groaned and before she could get a chance to fit her lips around the tip of his erection he yanked her back to her feet with one hand tugged his pants back up with the other do that and i'll finish before we even get a chance to begin then his mouth was on hers again his hot hand on her bare thigh and all thought of protest instantly scattered to the corners of her mind he slid his hand from beneath her sinfully short skirt and grasped her hips turning her until she was against the counter then lit fitting her on top of it her quiet laugh told of her surprise but it didn't stop her from spreading her legs and wantonly yanking him between them when the hard length of him nestled against her swollen folds through her panties she nearly cried out in exquisite pleasure she'd known the sexy duck would be good but for god's sake they hadn't really even done anything yet and she was a tongue flick away from orgasm he bent to a right breast forcing her to grope for supporting grip against the counter behind her her fingers touched something and she gland good to see that it was a cookie she pushed it out of the way arching her back as he fastened his mouth over her engorged nipple right through the material of her tank and bra dear god her womb contracted so violently she nearly catapulted from the counter sensing her crisis dylan ground against her his hold tightening his mouth breathing hot air through her tank and onto her damp nipple gracie her to low gut tightening mon fill the room and realized only distantly that it was her own as she succumbed to the delicious shivers wracking her body dylan pulled his mouth from her breast and lay his head against her shoulder oh god if i don't take you now gracie i swear i'm going to burst she began impatiently pushing his pants out of the way so take me he caught her wrists in his hands his green eyes intense i can't her heart dipped low in her stomach then rebounded to lodge in her thick throat what i i don't have anything to protect you damn it she nearly collapsed in a mixture of relief and unbearable pleasure freeing one of her wrists from his she dipped her fingers into the ve of her tank sliding out a brightly colored foil packet his brows drew slightly almost comically together as he looked from her to it and she knew that protection hadn't been the only thing stopping him from taking things between them all the way but she'd be damned if she was going to let him wriggle out of it now she slid her legs around his waist pulling him tightly against her now where were we she slanted her mouth against his feeling all powerful when after a brief hesitation he groaned and kissed her back with double the intensity he had earlier she wasn't sure if it was him or her but somehow they managed not only to free her of her panties but him of his pants and finally he was cradled between her legs his heart throbbing latex covered erection sandwiched between her slick,1

B00BCL4K2K,respects and rewards workers of all ages the cost to a business of replacing a disgruntled employee who is fortunate enough to find a greener pasture is approximately two and a half times his or her annual salary now more than ever that's a cost few companies can afford in the first edition of generations at work we made a case for a new crisis in the workplace that could be solved or partially solved by recognizing generational diversity the work world was then at the beginning of an awakening about generational issues and our primary objective was to convince readers that some common workplace complaints lack of respect and and an ability to work as a team for example could in many cases be attributed to generational differences we smiled to ourselves when you shared with us your aha moments via email and after speeches and seminars awareness was raised but in many cases that's as far as it went people got better at recognizing generation full speed bumps and even seeing how they affected work relationships and results but they were often unsure how to navigate the speed bumps this edition is less about raising awareness and more about problem solving we look at causes of generational behavior and approaches that not only reduce conflict but actually make generational differences as an organizational asset in these turbulent economic times it is even more critical that organizational leaders take steps that attract candidates with the right skills engage every employee to bring out the best each has to offer and create an environment that lowers anxiety boosts morale and increases productivity with that as our goal we invite you to listen and learn how to tap the potential of workers from all the generations the generations the generations vying with each other and today's workplace as we depict them are unique and a bit different than those commonly suggested by others for instance we defined the baby boom generation as those born from nineteen forty three to nineteen sixty others particularly population demographers to find the baby boom as ninety forty six to nineteen sixty four why the difference we have factored in the field as well as the fact of a generational cohort in our definitions for instance our research finds that people born between nineteen forty three and nineteen sixty have similar values and views as the true demographically defined baby boomers those born between nineteen forty six and nineteen sixty four likewise we date generation x from nineteen sixty rather than nineteen sixty five this again comes from our research and conclusion that the nineteen sixty to nineteen sixty four cohort act and think more like generation exerc than any other group in interviews and discussion groups most members of that set of birth years adamantly refused to be labelled boomers for any purpose our four generational groups therefore are one the traditionalist born before nineteen forty three those who grew up in the wake of the great depression and world war two and face the world with a can do attitude to the baby boomers born nineteen forty three to nineteen sixty those born during and after world war two and raised in an era of extreme optimism opportunity and progress three generation xers born nineteen sixty to nineteen eighty those born after the blush of the baby boom who came of age deep in the shadows of the boomers and the rise of the asian tiger for millennials born nineteen eighty to two thousand for those born of the baby boomers and early exercise into a culture where children were cherished nurtured and protected note that our generations overlap at their endpoints if we wouldn't utterly confuse everyone we would overlap them by three or four years there are no hard stops or road signs indicating when one generation ends and another begins please note that we are also aware of the danger of stereotyping whether by generation or gender to say that all boomers strive for their greatest human potential or that all exes are good project managers or that all millennials are hardworking optimists would be a mischaracterization even though those core traits tend to accurately describe the generation as a whole the research we rely on describes a cohort of people that includes tens of millions so whenever you take those generalizations and apply them to the guy in the next cubical you will run into problems rather than shoehorn your coworkers into the characteristics we describe for each generation learned to identify the characteristics and see if some of them fit the coworkers who are driving you crazy and then find creative ways to change your approach the most important thing to remember is that the specific markers of a generation's formative years do bind them together in exclusive ways to say for instance that millennials are more attuned to rock climbing and extreme sports than boomers doesn't,0

B01DUQRRZ6,is lying underneath a business begins with the vision if you can envision it then the next step is to articulate it you must articulate it to make it real but where does this vision come from what thomas edison famously said genius is one percent inspiration and ninety nine percent perspiration and the same may be true for inspiring nation itself for some people for the more fortunate souls the ability to create a vision is almost mystical or otherworldly the vision just appears in their minds some people wake up dreaming dreaming about something that becomes their vision but others really have to think it through to think about their situation and what it is that they want in a more deliberate way before they can develop a vision regardless in all cases it starts with an idea that needs to be explored this exploration can take on many forms when this book provides you with just one means to conduct that exploration it's one possible process out of many that may work for you as it has for me you'll find details examples and backstories support the process of taking that vision and making it a reality within this book however however here is the twelve step process or the science to approach business as an art each step as illustrated later step one briefly articulate the vision step to conduct a self assessment that include your own personal definition of success step three paint the picture by creating a document of at most three pages or better yet an actual work of art such as a painting a video website something that visually tells your story step four revise or refine the vision if necessary a step i honestly assess today's reality vs tomorrow's vision step six recognize the gaps between the vision and today's reality step number seven is identify goals that you will have to me in order to close the gap and define objectives that will measure the rate of success in achieving those goals step eight identify specific initiatives projects or actions that have to be taken to realize those objectives step nine determine how you will manage the initiatives this is also called project planning and measure progress toward the completion of those initiatives step ten termine how you will manage the business itself step eleven execute the plans and regularly measure your progress step twelve continue to review assess refine and modify the previous steps as necessary as you will note this twelve step process involves a healthy mix of science and art creating the vision determining goals and objectives and identifying initiatives or actions necessary to achieve the fall into the realm of art more than sigh science these tasks require imagination on the more scientific side are developing detailed project plans executing them and during progress let's start with a vision throughout this book we real examples of have a real time when i very successfully followed this twelve-step method i had been assigned to lead an acquired company that had one hundred and seventy employees and annual revenue of just over twenty one million dollars and a net profit a bid ten percent this was an information technology company that did a little bit of business processing process outsourcing on the side it had existed for more than twenty five years until my assignment the founders were still there leading the company many employees had never been employed by anyone else nepotism was not a dirty word i didn't know much about the particular markets in which the company was involved but i knew i knew about organizational leadership people in the business of business initially my only vision for this company was to just not screw it up after all we had acquired it because there was perceived value in it i knew i would want to do more with it than that eventually but initially that was it just don't screw it up what i really wanted to do who was get in there and grow this company thankfully i was just barely smart enough to realize that i had to look before leaping being unfamiliar with business there were a few things i needed to do before making any big moves so my first order of business was to learn more about the markets the services and the products in order to get to the bottom of how my vision for the company would establish itself i took time to get to know the people and the culture of the company i used a disciplined approach and the time i spent in this was invaluable i met with my direct staff and employees frequently talked to customers reviewed contracts and proposals and did a little market research i also employed consultants as a sub as subject matter experts when it made sense to do so fortunately i was allowed to take my time which is not always the case sometimes the pressure is too great or the need to turn,0

B01LZQ23K0,loli made her way toward the nurses station listening for further sound there was nothing the lack of noise had her more worried than the scream she had heard not long ago when she reached the end of the hallway she peeked around the corner but didn't see a single person it was okay she assured herself as she moved a little quicker to go down the next hallway which led to the e r doors she was sure her friend sandy was in there helping doctor stamos with an unruly patient the paramedics who had most likely brought the patient in must have already had the situation fully undergo control since she'd taken too long in the supply closet pushing open the e r door she didn't immediately see the crew her worry was for nothing she assured herself dr stamos she called out the e r door slammed shut behind her taking her breath away and causing her to jump at least a foot in the air hm literally have here a man in desperate need of a haircut and shave took his time perusing her body from head to toe with beady eyes as he shifted from foot to foot in front of her had i known such hot doctors were in this hospital i would have come in a whole lot sooner lindsay took a few seconds to assess the situation the man was obviously high on something or more likely many some things she didn't want to be within grabbing distance of him taking a couple of side steps she scooted away trying to nonchalantly put much needed distance between them he wasn't necessarily acting violently at this point but she almost felt naked with the way he was staring at her as if he could see her body through the loose scrubs wherein the hell were the paramedics and the doctor and where was sandy what are you doing in here lindsey asked him with as much calmness as she could muster his scabby lips went up in a grin and he had some medical care doc he said taking a step closer to her she shifted sideways and backward i am not a doctor but i can get one for you she said wanting to get away from this man and to a phone where she could call for reinforcements his laugh sent a chill through her this place seems like a ghost town to me little dock he told her lindsay weighed her odds of getting through the door she'd just come in but the man was nearer to it than she was plus she wasn't sure where doctor stamos or sandy were and she felt like an animal in a small cage there are plenty of staff here sir if you'll just sit down over there i'll get someone to help you right away she said with bravado i think you're telling me a lie a little dark i have a feeling you're all by your lonesome in here now that just don't seem right he told her as he continued to box her in matter of fact habit we have us at least a good hour or so before we get more docs come into your aid his meaning was clear and lindsay had to swallow the bile in her throat she'd grown up with four brothers and this man wasn't going to take her down easily the problem was that she didn't know where sandy or doctor stamos were or when anyone else would enter the hospital she needed to get help the man took another step toward her and her fear was almost all consuming fight or flight had most certainly kicked in and she was ready to knee this guy as hard as she could and then run for help as he flopped on the ground like the weasel he obviously was you're wrong there are plenty of people in the halls but more importantly the ambulance will be here any second now she bluffed if only her voice was stronger even in her own ears it sounded weak and pathetic there was a light of victory shining in the man's eyes that told her her bluff wasn't working he knew they were virtually alone and he held a royal flush in his hands it was her strength against his and though he wasn't a big man he was bigger than she was just as she decided to run on a pained screams sounded from the only other emergency room she twisted her head for only a moment to gaze in that direction the moment was all her attacker needed he pounced much,1

B06XRNBZF6,bethany turned and looked around the tiny garage boxes piled high on both sides of her there was no way they were going to be able to get her mother's place fully loaded up by nightfall why in the hell the woman would want to was the question she'd gotten a wild hair that everything needed to be moved out of the old house and put into storage before the wedding three days away letting out a long sigh bethany pushed her chestnut hair back the messy burn at the back of her head not doing it's job at all her mother walked in from the front of the garage a few cars having stopped to see if they were having a garage sale go call madden can't some one wants the washer and dryer ma em we should just donate all of this stuff there's no reason to sell it i am donating it go get them sweet girl turning bethany checked her phone for the tenth time within the hour damon was at the office holding down the fort so the rest of them could help pack he was the only one she wanted to see the idea of her mother getting married suddenly weighing heavily on her kent was a great guy but her real father was two when they first got married her mother deserve the best bethany hoped this time that's what she was getting her new stepfather had been nothing but kind and giving but everyone knew that even hell had recruiting days hopefully things would be different this time she opened the door to the small two bedroom house and stuck her head inside hey guys some one wants the washer and dryer come help us load it for them closing the door she pulled her phone from her pocket and let out a groan mom i need to change and get up to the college i have to get in a few hours with dr harrington today i thought you told him you were working yesterday instead i do did but school starts next week and the mess he gave me to work through yesterday didn't get entirely done i don't want to leave him in a lurch i need him on my side for the next year then get going her mom walked toward her a smile on her pretty face the guys walked into the garage mat making caveman noises as if they were the only reason the washer and dryer were able to get loaded bethany looked over her shoulder and rolled her eyes playfully the men folk are here now let's get something done matt smirked as kent popped him in the chest which car baby can't glanced toward bethany's mom her cheeks turning a rose color the green truck with the open tailgate she walked toward them we can help to heck no you're not you get hurt and who will marry my dad stand down karen we've got this matt kissed his biceps one at a time before moving towards the washer bethany leaned against the wall closest to her matt was so different than damon and yet they had a friendship that permeated the air around them every time she had seen them together the longing for damon to be there with her rolled over her again the guys lifted the washing machine with ease and walked out toward the waiting truck as bethany's mom moved to stand beside her glancing over she realized her mom had tears in her eyes hey you okay bethany wrapped an arm around her shoulders and tugged her close yes i just don't deserve can't he's far better of a person than me bethany that's not true bethany pulled her mom into a hug resting her cheek on the same shoulder that she had for the last twenty two years he's a good man but you're a great woman you are a little biased damn straight i am bethany moved back and reached up wiping at her mom's tears how damon would harbor hate against his own mom was understandable but so painful to think about bethany wouldn't have survived the trauma of all her birth father put them through if her mom hadn't been the rock she was damon's past hurts were different but just as life altering watch your mouth her mom pulled back as a smile spread across her face i'm so excited about leaving tomorrow but i'm scared too of the flight i'll be on the plane with you bethany reached up and tugged her hair down working to redo it no of not being who can't needs me to be he's got all his shit together and i feel like the hot mess express on a good day her mom chuckled and wiped a few more tears turning so her back was to the guys as they walked back in matt continued to tout their greatness as bethany shook her head at him enjoying the sound of his laughter watch your language she turned back to her mom softly squeezing the older woman's shoulders can't loves you just the way you are he doesn't need you to be him just be yourself and everything will work out mom i love you little girl i love you too i need to get it for the college bethany released her mom and ran her hands over her shirt the college is closed right now and i'm not even sure if dr harrington is up there does this look too bad to just drop by for an hour or so should i get dressed up her mom reached out and brushed her hand down bethany's back change into a blouse instead of this t-shirt and you should be good to go your jeans aren't dirty before you go tell me how the situation with your friends is going bethany's best friend and roommate krista had gone off the deep end a few days earlier attacking their other best friend jake and leaving him for dead it was still a mystery as to what would lead krista to react so violently to jake turning her down it had to be a combination of being off her medication combined with having her heartbroken it seemed to be the most likely reason jake is going home on monday his parents are with him now he's doing better just shaken up i haven't spoken to

B00OZ7XO2K,as of this state you've already ensured that mccall had said he thinks so governor holland had answered grimly let the whites and blacks leave bloody white and black bodies strewn all over the streets of banbury and see how fast the historians would call me a bum but what am i talking about the hell with me i don't want people killed there mike it's that simple though how are you going to stop a head on collision if harlan james is convicted you'd have to pull a miracle mccall had said haven't you heard governor miracle is my middle name speaking with a cheering as he was very far from feeling harlan james was the fiery leader of the black militant organization in banbury who called themselves the black hearts he was under indictment charged with violating the state's sedition law the charge alleged that at the blackheart school for revolutionaries james had taught his novices how to make bombs and explosive cocktails out of everyday materials that furthermore he had preached to his students the necessity of blowing up those honky business establishments both in and out of the banbury ghetto which were guilty of discriminatory hiring practices until his briefing mccall had assumed that the banbury authorities had substantial grounds for bringing the black leader to trial but his information governor holland told mccall was that the indictment of james was largely a political ploy by the opposition party mayor potter can't make any public statements about the james case prior to the trial of course the governor had said but privately he's informed me that he believes james is being framed he says the district attorney then weasel volker is deliberately trying to promote race trouble in banbury so that his fair haired boy boy horton will be swept into office by the white backlash under his ringing law and order slogan this is a bad time for old potter to be retiring from politics even at his age he could beat horton but jerome duncan for all his ability and charm is a black man and and if there's racial violence before the election the blue collar whites are absolutely certain to vote against him until the last election for an entire generation heywood potter's machine had consistently delivered the banbury vote to the governor's party but mayor potter had grown old and foe four years earlier his iron political grip on the city had weakened gerald horton who owned local radio station b o kao had been elected city councilman at large and an obscure lawyer named volker had sneaked out of the political woodwork and smear talked his way to a surprising victory over the incumbent district attorney his opponent was a quiet and conscientious prosecutor who had done his job quietly and conscientiously for sixteen years and he promptly after his death feet suffered a coronary occlusion and went to his quiet reward since hortons and volcker's victories the opposition had steadily gathered momentum until now it was ready to make a serious run against the party in power in the race for all city and county offices mayor potter was eighty four his announcement that he would not run again had created a vacuum in his party the primary contest for the mayoral candidacy into the vacuum stepped governor holland and with some prodding from the governor's mansion heywood potter they endorsed jerome duncan the back room talk in the capital was that old haywood had growled hail sam it's not his color you know me better than that it's that he can't win and the governor had said i think he can given the right support and you and i haywood are the right support the party strategists grumbled but mayor potter talked of how much jerome duncan resembled carl b stokes in looks and charisma an argument which impressed everyone but himself and duncan easily won the nomination in the primary on cold analysis his chance of winning the city elo action was another matter entirely duncan was a widely respected lawyer and he was state president of the naacp but he had little political experience he could be expected to get a virtually solid black vote but it was calculated that he needed more than twenty five percent,0

B01MSLIGQQ,research more than a decade ago the gallup organization took a broad view of how companies were managing their people and determined that most organizations were shooting in the dark the typical business commissioned an excruciatingly long survey of employee opinion hoping that somewhere among one hundred or two hundred questions it would stumble upon the concepts that mattered when the results returned they were too cumbersome to feed back to the troops where no one would have known what to do with them anyway executives assumed there was a general level of satisfaction that pretty much applied throughout the company and that they the senior team were the main drivers of their employees' feelings about the company all these assumptions were wrong gallup assembled a select team of it's social scientists to examine the one million employee interviews then in it's database the hundreds of questions that had been asked over the preceding decades and every variable on business unit performance that organizations had supplied with their employee rosters these data were analyzed to find which survey questions and therefore which aspects of work were most powerful and explaining workers productive motivations on the job ultimately twelve elements of work life emerged as the core of the unwritten social contract between employee and employer through their answers to the dozen most important questions and their daily actions that affected performance the million workers were saying if you do these things for us we will do what the company needs of us the twelve elements of great managing that emerged from the research are as follows one i know what is expected of me at work too i have the materials and equipment i need to do my work right three at work i have the opportunity to do what i do best every day for in the last seven days i have received recognition or praise for doing good work five my supervisor or someone at work seems to care about me as a person sex there is someone at work who encourages my development seven at work my opinions seem to count aid the mission or purpose of my company makes me feel my job is important nine my associates or fellow employees are committed to doing quality work ten i have a best friend at work eleven and the last six months someone at work has talked to me about my progress twelve this last year i have had opportunities at work to learn and grow behind each of these is a fundamental truth about human nature on the job the correlations between each element and better performance not only draw a roadmap to superior managing they also reveal fascinating insights into how the human mind molded by thousands of years of foraging hunting cooperating within a close knit and stable tribe reacts in a relatively new artificial world of cubicles project timelines corporate ambiguity and constantly changing work group membership people neither were created to fit corporate strategies nor have evolved to do so rather than contest these facts the most successful managers harness the drive virtuosity and spirit that come with employing humans even as they understand the inevitable chinks in their armor the twelve crucial statements were disseminated widely in the bestselling first break all the rules published in nineteen ninety nine much of it's success stemmed from challenging the prevailing ideas in ways that helped executives better understand what peanuts already knew such as why he would do things for lou that he wouldn't do even for the company's chief executive leaders on snorting steeds are important but great managers are the bedrock of great organizations tom peters wrote in touting the discoveries great managers are an organizations glue they create and hold together the scores of folks who power high performing companies many executives struggled to formulate a strategy for increasing profits through their employees often they resort to the simple arithmetic of fewer employees equals lower costs without considering the wide range and productivity that depends on each person's engagement i don't think enough investors have asked the more him important question can companies be even more successful by focusing on optimizing each,0

B002V0QEB6,when the rest of europe what did fifteen years of conquest mean france was a progressive power a liberal power who brought many progressive things to europe besides the dictatorship the dictatorship of course is one of the undersides but there are many parts of the french imperial mission which were revolutionary and forward looking and with an introduction institutions whose goals we can sympathize with in the twenty first century what was the cost of liberty liberty as it turns out was very expensive europeans had to pay a very great deal to be liberated from napoleon and thus one of the consequences is resistance the nature of resistance is going to another gonna be another one of our themes how it is that progressive reform was resisted by ordinary people sometimes because they resented their community norms being violated and they often did defend themselves because the french were seen as irreligious invaders de christianize hers atheists and even in the spanish case sorcerers the cost of liberty that was very very great and at the end we will witness the resilience of the european old regime napoleon's empire after all collapsed under the powers the four great powers of austria prussia russia and great britain which were largely an reformed illiberal aristocratic lee dominated ecclesiastic the dominated european states in eighteen fifteen young men young students idealistic people could be well be forgiven for thinking that a great opportunity had been lost with napoleon and that leads to his legacy which is the myth of napoleon as the liberator as the radical reformer indeed as a revolutionary a diet as you will see see that's how he began what we want to do in this series of lectures is look at napoleon more for the point of view of his impact and the point of view of the context in which he operated the context here is all important my argument is going to be that napoleon represents a continuity in a certain style of warfare and rev evolutionary warfare and that revolutionary warfare was a warfare that emphasized liberation of the conquered peoples contradictory as this seems the man was a dictator france was a dictatorship nonetheless relative to the rest of europe french revolutionary warfare was profoundly liberating so what was new about napoleon first of all there's nothing new about military technology that was available to him there's less little technical innovation napoleon himself was notoriously conservative in technical matters despite the fact he was a military engineer he was indifferent for example to the concrete rockets invented by the british in the early eighteen hundreds this was at a rocket adapted from a material that the british had seen their opponents in india use that carried explosions and shrapnel the british use it against the french at bu line in eighteen o five and against the danes in copenhagen agen and eighteen o seven wellington it should be said dislike them too because he thought that they were a terror weapon and they were used against civilians and he was against that napoleon was also largely indifferent to other innovations like balloons which was used at the battle of flus and seventeen ninety four and he was indifferent to semaphores arts as a way of communicating rapidly across large territories equipment that a soldier had was largely traditional did not change between the old regime monarchy the revolution and the early nineteenth century a soldier was equipped with a with a standard musket issued in seventeen seventy seven it's a musket with a large barrel five feet long and loading was very meticulous but it had to be done quickly imagine this a cartridge containing a ball and powder was ripped with a teeth ripped open with a teeth some powder was dropped into a priming pan which was then closed the rest of the powder was poor down a barrel the barrel was followed by the ball paper stuffed in his wadding and a ramrod tapped all this down this had to be done very rapidly meticulously and it took a lot of training many soldiers could in fact do this once every thirty seconds and ah for us that would be extremely difficult the musket was no toy seriously inaccurate there was no back sight the front sight was obscured by a bayonet then the smoke of battle it needed cleaning after three or four shots the ball was smaller than the bore the thus reducing velocity and it missed half the time at eighty yards distance under battlefield conditions one got a hit i have an opponent roughly every five shots,0

B0172CEIC4,a vicious underbite a cool shallow river lapped at his ankles whispering in a language he relished but could not comprehend the man looked down at his nude body reddish brown sunburned skin hairy bony legs thin hands falling beneath a small pot belly and his genitals small and retracted the river mud squished pleasantly through his toes it was a mild day if he were lost this wouldn't be a bad place to wander but where would he go this sudden birthing of consciousness left him paralyzed with uncertainty he seemed to know things words tree sky mud but who he was and why he lived gnawed at his mind like the hunger in his stomach the man stepped out of the water and onto the warm river sand he looked up and down the curving bank about twenty yards upstream he saw what he knew to be his own footsteps careening along the riverbank and then cutting into the water downstream the river snaked through the valley meadow the man had an urge to continue downstream but he felt an even greater impulse to know from whence he had come perhaps his footprints would lead him to other people like himself he took a deep breath and the scent of pine revived his spirits as he trudged upstream when the man reached his old tracks he noticed that they looked different hurried and less distinct as if he had been running had he been pursued by something a wild beast or anatomy of some kind if so where were the creature's tracks the man paused and inspected his body for wounds but found nothing whatever it was it had not captured him or if it had it did not harm him or leave a trace of it's intention his tracks grew fainter as he walked farther upstream the river also became swifter and the shore became covered with granite boulders and thick mesquite bushes the man paused at a small still pool that had formed along the shore between two rocks and knelt to take a drink then recoil when he saw his reflection in the water his face was nothing like he expected it was covered with a scraggly black beard his brown bloodshot eyes were sunken under a heavy ridged brow and his thick black hair grew wildly from a large square head his mouth was filled with jagged yellow tea teeth his incisors were sharp and oversized and his nose wide with large upturned nostrils the man felt his face with his hands to confirm the information from his eyes and then reexamined his reflection what sort of face was this if he saw someone like this he would be terrified his mind strained to recall itself without success the dryness in his throat became overwhelming and he dipped his face into the water his lips mercifully distorting the image with ripples as he drank deeply his thirst quenched the man sat for a moment and listened the birds chirped and even patterns pausing at times the wind stirred the tall pines and the trees creaked and gratitude a squirrel tittered on a branch above him the man stood on a rock and gazed up at the towering granite walls of the river valley the impulse to yell overcame him he sucked in a great breath but the air rushed out with a groan he tried again and the strange croaky made surprised him he tried to make the croak louder but it only distorted and fell in pitch he gave up and moved on the trees grew thicker the underbrush denser and the sound of the river receded as the man pushed aside young saplings and drove deeper into the alpine forest soon he came upon an enormous tree he paused it's trunk was perhaps thirty feet thick and one hundred feet high it is bark red and rubbery the man leaned against it's enormity for a moment engulfed by it's massive stillness the man's face relaxed and he drifted like a suckling babe during nursing lulled into subconsciousness a sharp cry in the distance dragged him back into the world his ears perked with wolf like intensity he heard the yell again it was familiar from a being like him,0
B002V59VAC,nemec philosophy is landlocked in a desert of pedantic and idealism i told my friends management consulting represents a return to the material world from which philosophy must draw its inspiration i pictured myself standing on the foxhole of a mighty corp on the hunt for the great white whale of global capitalism to the east asian markets mate ease i shouted out in my mind the blows a profit opportunity i was tempted to call myself ishmael in short i was not only unemployable but a potential menace to the working people of the world in any case my competitive ins stinks had already overwhelmed any merely rational deliberations about the course on which i was set the interview might as well have been for a position as a tennis instructor now that i was in the running i was determined to ace it over the next two weeks i read the financial times cover to cover every morning i set aside my turgid germans in favor of a copy of tom peters and robert waterman breezy best zeller in search of excellence from which i learned to say things like hands on value-driven and to extol the virtues of simultaneous loose tight properties whatever those were every night i put myself to sleep literally with a textbook on corporate finance on a drizzly spring morning in nineteen eighty eight in a baroque style hotel conference room littered with recently emptied louis the fifteenth chairs i squared off against henry a dapper a silver haired fifty ish englishman with an angular head that looked too big for his small frame i leaned forward in my seat tugging at the sleeves of a suit that seemed to have grown tighter since its glory days on the high school debate team and awaited the opportunity to deliver my fortnight's worth of insights on globalization securitization and the driving need of modern corporations to develop those simultaneous loose tight properties in the face of relentless international competition i was prepared if necessary to expound my theory that management consulting is a lot like whale hunting after the briefest of greetings henry smiled or perhaps smirked rubbed his chin and cocked his head a little sideways then he looked straight at me and asked as though the question had just occurred to him how many pubs are there in great britain life is full of surprises and that's mostly a good thing every surprise is an opportunity for learning my career as a management consultant was a long list of learning opportunities like all other consultants i owe my education to the extraordinary generosity of clients with their assistance i traveled the world and became an expert in several dozen subjects i helped found a new consulting firm it shot up like a rocket and then exploded in a fireball of recriminations and lawsuits then the stock market in it's inscrutable wisdom scattered rewards and punishments with benign indifference a among the merely undeserving and the viciously incompetent the experiment that began in my interview with henry lasted ten years frankly it got a little out of hand at times it got ugly but in the end it did yield some interesting and unexpected results my experience posed a series of disturbing questions questions that eventually prompted me to write this book the trouble began even before my interview on pub life in great britain with a particularly nagging question why on earth would anybody hire me as a management consultant shortly after receiving my one and only offer i rephrased the question why would anybody hire a firm that would hire me i squandered quite a bit of mental energy batting away the suspicion that maybe the firm had made an embarrassing mistake where it's partners smacking themselves on the forehead wondering what had possessed them to conduct such a hazardous experiment in truth however the most remarkable aspect of my entry into the field of consulting was just how unremarkable it was at the time and even now firms just like mine were maniacally hiring all kinds of people some of whom if it is possible to imagine were even less qualified than me beginning in the early nineteen eighties a giant sucking sound could be heard on elite university campuses it was coming from what one recent author aptly calls the world's newest profession although management consulting dates from the early decades of the twentieth century,0

B009P51M4O,as the revised edition of this book is being written it is nineteen ninety eight and for this time we have seen a commercial release of the electric car general motors makes one and ford and chrysler are sure to follow let's assume the cars work like any other except they are quieter and better for the environment now the question is when are you going to buy one the technology adoption life cycle your answer to the preceding question will tell a lot about how you relate to the technology adoption life cycle a model for understanding the acceptance of new products if your answer is not until hell freezes over you are probably a very late adopter of technology what we call in the model a laggard if your answer is when i have seen electric cars prove themselves and when there are enough service stations on the road you might be a middle of the road adopter or in the model the early majority if you say not until most people have made the switch and it becomes really inconvenient to drive a gasoline car you are probably more of a follower a member of the late majority if on the other hand you want to be the first one on your block with an electric car you're apt to be an innovator or an early adopter in a moments we are going to take a look at these labels in greater detail but first we need to understand their significance it turns out our attitude toward technology adoption become significant at least in a marketing sense anytime we are introduced to products that require us to change our current mode of behavior or to modify other products and services we rely on in academic terms such change sensitive products are called discontinuous innovations the contrasting term continuous innovations refers to the normal upgrading of products that does not require us to change behavior for example when crest promises you whiter teeth that is a continuous innovation you still are brushing the same teeth in the same way with the same toothbrush when ford's new torres promises better mileage when dell's latest computer promises faster processing times and more storage space or when sony promises sharper and brighter tv pictures these are all continuous innovations as a consumer you don't have to change your ways in order to take advantage image of these improvements on the other hand if the sony were a high definition tv it would be incompatible with today's broadcasting standards which would require you to seek out special sources of programming this would be a discontinuous innovation because you would have to change your normal tv viewing behavior similarly if the new dell computer were to come with a b operating system it would be incompatible with today's software base again you would be required to seek out a whole new set of software thereby classifying this too as a discontinuous innovation or if the new ford car as we just noted required electricity instead of gasoline or if the new toothpaste were a mouthwash that did not use a toothbrush then once again you would have a product incompatible with your current infrastructure of supporting components in all these cases the innovation demands significant changes by not only the consumer but also the infrastructure that is how and why such innovations come to be called discontinuous between continuous and discontinuous long as a spectrum of demands for change tv dinners on like microwave dinners did not require the purchase of a new oven but they did require the purchase of more freezer space color tv programming did not like vc ours require investing in and mastering a new technology but they did require buying a new tv and learning more about tuning and antennas than many of us wanted to learn the special washing instructions for certain fabrics special street lanes reserved for bicycle riders the special dialing instructions for calling overseas all represent some new level of demand on the consumer to absorb a change in behavior,0
B00U1XCAOA,we all know that our industry publishing is going through a massive disruption caused by new technology the disruption is in two areas the production system and the distribution system it's easy and cheap to produce a book these days understand that i'm not talk thing about writing one i'm talking about the things that happen after the book is finished please be clear on that because if you misunderstand that point you'll miss the point of the entire chapter in the past it took tens of thousands of dollars to produce an actual physical book then you'd end up with a warehouse or a garage full of books and no way to get them to a customer in the early part of the twentieth century a lot of writers self published and ponied up large amounts of money to produce the book but by the middle of the century writers couldn't get the books to market even if the writers produced the books traditional publishers created a lock on the distribution system that way is pretty extreme books went from the publisher's warehouse to hundreds of distributors all over the country who sent the books to bookstores truck stops and drugstores any place that wanted books could get them that system was already breaking down when amazon started up in the mid nineteen nineties the mail main part of the distribution system had collapsed by the end of the century murdered by large stores that wanted centralized ordering the day of the local distributor who knew what his customers wanted disappeared books got delivered to bookstores and a few non bookstore chains like grocery stores but the small non bookstores that used to get a spinner rack of books those books couldn't order books if they tried the markets that got books to readers contracted traditional publishers responded to this contraction by getting rid of the bulk of their sales reps leaving a small sales force that mostly sold to a handful of buyers traditional publishers changed editorial strategy to meet the new reality trying to find books that would appeal to a mass audience just as the mass audience in all other parts of entertainment was breaking into pieces if traditional publishers want to know why am amazon was successful it was because amazon distributed books to people who wanted them amazon didn't try to dictate who should get what book nor did it chastise it's customers for shopping elsewhere something a lot of independent bookstores still do the shopping experience on amazon wasn't pleasant at first first it isn't always pleasant now but it is useful and more importantly easy thanks to amazon and other online retailers books went from the publisher to the online site to the customer note that this procedure cut out at least one middleman combine the changes in disk tribulation with the ease of production and suddenly mid list writers and wannabe writers didn't have to go to traditional publishers to get books to readers if the only change in the system had been the rise of low cost self published books and there had been no ebooks writers still would be going direct in much larger numbers than ever before as the outlets for books shrank traditional publishers did nothing to compensate nothing here's what a physical book rack is it's advertising even if a shopper does not buy a book off that rack she sees the books notes them and maybe decides to buy them from her favorite store or get the book from the library people discover books by browsing i don't care how good amazon's analytics are they simply do not compare to that moment of discovery that moment when a weird looking book catches your eye you pick it up and realize that it's heavier than expected and the deckle edge makes the book prettier than you originally thought holding a book is a sensual experience one that book lovers adore you might decide to buy the ebook instead but you might never have seen that book if you hadn't been standing in that store at the moment the book was on the shelf and you happen to see an intriguing cover or title or something traditional publishers panicked about the changes in distribution but did nothing to combat it,0

B01M4OCNB1,it's dawn on the sixth of july nineteen forty one and the australians are putting in their first men prepare to attack on the french defensive position of doma the men defensive position covering beirut now that the french have taken out of position on the other side of the moore river they're protected by the deep water of the river itself which cuts back into the into the hills and makes a natural obstacle to any advance but apart from the river itself there are the steep sides of the of the ravine and it's almost impossible for any trips to advance with ease across that ravine but the main french prepared defensive positions are slightly across the river on the other side and already judging from the success of the artillery barrage and what i know the plan to be arrington did already have crossed the river down coast on the sector where we are and they have already put in their attack on the french positions well the french world again and interest with olive groves adjusted from the coast and in a banana plantation which runs right up the coast from the river to the dima now let me give you an idea of what our actual position is in relation to the scene of action but ten of dima is situated about half a mile in from the shore and it's about a mile and a half or sorry about fifteen hundred yards north of the river the hill where we're broadcasting at the moment is about fifteen hundred yards south of the river that is about fifteen hundred yards from the french front line and about it's about two or three thousand yards in front of our men artillery concentrations were hidden away we have pretty well in a tree with a small sang a dugout beside a certain amount of protection in case they throw anything back this way now all through the night last night and artillery were concentrating heavy fire on the french positions just across the river and further back and from time to time we saw large fires make out in demurred itself and at the rear of the french tradition suggesting that you might have got all the dumps or some other income malaria is now this morning at the twenty minutes to five the main where i started and for some minutes now the shells have been a whistling overhead and thundering down on the french positions so far the french haven't answered back with verre much i dunno whether you're going to hear very much of the of the sound of what's going on because even week and only heavy heroin guns firing thankfully but we can hear the griffin requiring of shell as they come and of course i had a few hundred feet up and from time to time particularly low incomes you even hear that the leaves of this tree russell now about half a mile away on my right the friendship plastering the hill with mortified the two have just gone off now in good spouts of of of got rid of dark dust of curling upwards as a matter of fact they're giving him after that he'll such hell freeman mortar bombs have just burst there and there is a an area of perhaps a quarter mile deepen half a mile wide which is absolutely covered with with very very dull ok smoke is of that particular hillside is volcanic and the soil is black and the rock is dark and shells bursting into the reservoir surely dr yes good thanks mclaren settle who's your who's haven't been keeping watch on the other flankers just call after that the actual print they're showing and sharing it with remarkable accuracy happens to be a road and they've crashed in right along the road that runs on on the forward slope of that hill because presumably there are vehicle garage trying to get along they're practically every second now most of the dying off there and it's a i don't suppose it's it's more than ok but recorded a mile from where we are hang on a second and i'll have a look through the glasses this particular position everything's obscure and data about this groggy haze of dust that was not there at the moment not even any more bombs landing it kristin was thinking about the presentation of his reports his parents had heard one of his reports from damour and thought he had been speaking too quickly but he explained that describing a battle at a distance was around the dough and speaking quickly helped to build up the excitement wilmot was an experience descriptive commentator at sporting and other events even before he became,0

B006JQ38FI,the sun beat down on harry pinching his coffin and archie penrose shifted the weight on his shoulder in a vain attempt to alleviate his discomfort instead the oak seemed to press harder against his neck and every time he breathed in he caught a faint whiff of polish from the wood it's sweet house proud sen john jarring sharply with the mood of the day the heat was extreme for the time of year and that alone would have been oppressive combined with the other demands on his senses it was almost unbearable and he was glad when he heard the stable clock strikes noon a signal for the small group of men to move towards the waiting her us a funeral was not how he had intended to spend the first day of his holiday this fortnight on his family's cornish estate was supposed to be a much needed break from the professional interest which he took in death more importantly he had made a promise to himself that these few days would mark a fresh start to his long difficult and press his friendship with josephine tey they had known each other now for twenty years but eighteen of those have been clouded by secrets and guilt and only the tragic events of the previous year had allowed them to clear the air once and for all since then they had seen each other a few times in london but this would be the first chance they had had to spend any length of time together and to enjoy a new ease and honesty in their friendship admittedly they were supposed to have traveled down together and the fact that a corpse had already changed their plans could be seen as an ill omen but with summer here early and josephine do on the afternoon train archie was optimistic that death ends sadness would soon be behind them it wasn't possible to forget the past and neither of them would have wanted to but perhaps from now on it would strengthen their bond instead of creating an awkwardness that both of them had tried to avoid the wooden hoes which to just a few feet away was an open no nonsense affair appropriate to the a young man whose body it was to carry and in a gesture of remarkable forgiveness archie thought drawn by the horse which had killed him it had been painstakingly decorated in the glorious assortment of flowers that cornel offered up at this time of year all gathered from local gardens by friends who were glad of a simple way to express their sorrow the bearers walked slowly forward careful to keep in step and archie was close enough to the man in front to see the muscles in his neck tightened with the strain of weight and responsibility as they lowered the coffin gently onto the cart he could see his own relief reflected in the faces of the others they had stood for just a short time with harry's body on their shoulders but it had been long enough for the midday sun to soak their funeral,0
B07QZTK3G8,chapter three the professor and his team worked feverishly to find out where or when the team ended up in their timeline no feedback trace came back through so they are frantically going through mathematical equations and pondering quantum mechanics to figure out where they went wrong so they could come up with a solution tim what have you got for me asked the professor nathan professor i got nothing from all cows we should be able to distinguish where they are in the timeline however i can't even locate a skip trace from the porto alignment the professor ponders their conundrum for a few minutes and tries to come up with a reasonable or hypothesis that might explain the disappearance of the time travelers he suddenly pops out of his chair it almost yells aloud to his team what if they aren't lost in a timeline what if they traveled to a parallel dimension tim looks at the professor as if he just said something crazy and can't understand the babbling key coming out of his mouth what what do you mean a parallel dimension i know we talked about it but i never gave it any merit as a possibility of time travel if they are stuck in a parallel dimension that could explain the absence of a feedback trace added tim the two men looked at each other and then at the other t team members for confirmation some mobile and nod their heads in agreement it might be a possibility according to their theories on quantum mechanics so what do you want to do professor asked him shall be recalibrate the portal and try to locate the parallel dimension through the old sub routines we used before or do do we just chalk it up to fate and try again with a new team well it would be easy just to abandon them and try again however i'm not that cold hearted and we will do everything are smart as hell brains can do to come up with a way to find them now call up that old portal sub routine and let's see what we can accomplish tim and the rest of the team turned to their stations and everyone begins feverishly decoding the mission parameters left over from the nonexistent portal trace in an effort to find the last time travelers the professor watches as tim and the others write equations and pour through quantum theories in an effort to recreate to portal parameters they set their team to somewhere other than the past as he observes each member he keeps track of every detail as each tries to come up with a solution just when he decides they're on a path to failure he stops in front of one of the team member stations and just stares professor professor the professor turns and stares blankly at tim as he's taken by the arms and shaken a bit what what is it why are you shaking me the professor asked in a daze sir you are locked in some kind of trance staring blankly at that terminal in front of you what was it that you saw timmy the answer was always right there we just didn't see the trees for the forest take a look at this set of equations you'll see what i mean tim looks past the professor and studies the screen his eyes get wide and he lets out a small gasp as if he seen the sun for the first time how can that be i don't know how but it happened now we have to figure out how to recreate the exact same conditions in order to bring them home that might not be possible the other members mumbled and nodded as if they knew it was a fool's errand to try to recreate an anomaly of such magnitude it might be a complete waste of time however that's what we're here for and that's what we have to work with everyone quit bellyaching about what we can't do and see what we can do do the scientists return to their stations they continue to decipher the math and physics the room is quiet except for the tapping of computer consoles and low hushed voices as they discuss the problem in small groups the professor sits back in his own chair and begins the task of replaying the entire recorded se sequence of the time traveling team as they entered the event horizon and vanished he just couldn't figure out what went wrong as he rubbed his eyes and ruffled his hair left uncombed for three days he muttered to himself what the hell did i do wrong the group before all waited around the location where they came through portal for most of the day john wasted away his time by throwing rocks and investigating everything within a hundred feet of their home base as he liked to call it he liked to give names to everything like it was right out of a baseball game sticks were beds and dirt clods were baseball's hell he even tried to get henry to play a small game of whack the dirt clod with him however henry wasn't interested in playing games he was worried they'd be stuck,0

B00EQAABM2,in the thick of darkening shadows from the cedar cops reaming the outskirts of the parking lot a silent figure in a red suit long white beard and shiny black boots waited watching the back entrance of the tavern hungry to catch a glimpse of one person and in particular after an interminable half hour shortly before midnight the rear door to the horny toad opened hinges creaking in the cold and letting out the strain of the eagles singing please come home for christmas the water tensed heart pounding and wind burned hands fisted inside the pockets of the santa costume a woman appeared once upon a time she'd possessed beautiful blonde hair but now it had grown steely grey the watchers breath caught she had stopped dyeing her hair she carried a black garbage bag heavy with clanking bottles and started toward the dumpster her movements graceful as always years ago she'd been a dallas cowboy cheerleader and she'd kept her slender hourglass figure even into her sixth decade of life but instead of the mini skirts she usually favored because she had the most sensational legs of any woman in town no matter what their age she wore oversized blue jeans and a gray wool sweater with a saggy him the watchers tongue moistened parched lips wishing wishing for so many things wishing but unable to make those dreams come true you couldn't turn back the clock no matter how hard you might try redemption was so close and yet so far away the garbage bag made a muffled thumping sound when it landed in the dumpster the air smelled of juniper and woodsmoke she dusted her hands and turned toward the bar her breath came out in frosty puffs the moonlight caught her face her eyes were worn thin exhausted the watcher shifted in the darkness gut twisting don't go stay stay so i can see you for just a little while longer one last time she paused and looked out into the darkness her face a portrait of abject bleakness a lump blocked the watchers throat the woman shook her head pushed open the door roy orbison was singing pretty paper sad songs all sad christmas songs she stepped inside the door snapping shut behind her a single chile tear tracked down the watchers cheek gone everything once loved and taken for granted was now forever gone last call raylene pringle said more out of habit than necessity there was only one patron left and the horny toad on this lonely saturday night and he never drank more than a single glass of whiskey i have another one night on good nate divers knock back the last swallow a whiskey set the empty glass down on the bar for the past six months he'd been coming into the bar almost every night he arrived late had one drink and went home neat didn't talk much about himself deflected questions by sitting alone on the far side of the bar beside the benjamin ficus he was on the optimistic side of forty and very good looking with coal black hair lightly salted at the temples and peacock blue eyes he was built like a keith black hemi engine big strong,1
B071FCMPCM,it is late spring in eighteen thirty one six hundred miles west of st louis on the trail to santa fe a solitary mounted white man cautiously rides two or three miles in advance of the traitors wagon caravan in which he is a leading investor the landscape presents a dusty expanse of treeless plains the air is hot enough to make the man feel as if he were standing before an open oven door and water is nowhere to be found squinting in the harsh sunshine he scans the arid land for signs of verger that would proclaim the cimarron river and offer relief from the dehydration that threatens men and livestock alike at length the buckskin clad rider spots a dip in the prairie it must be the river or at least a waterhole he rides closer and is startled when he comes upon several mixed blood new mexican traitors perhaps he has heard tales of these men called come and churros ever since about seventeen twenty small parties of daring new mexicans had carried on a precarious risky trade with the comanche nation having just conclude at another trade session with their unpredictable indian partners they too are alarmed when they see the stranger on his jaded horse unwilling to risk their own lives on behalf of someone they do not know the common churros offer no assistance but they signal that comanches are nearby and that the man has no hope of evading the indians the white man rides forward reaching the edge of the prairie depression he spots a party of warriors on horseback a half mile off and they have seen him too the man braces for action for he has participated in many ugly confrontations with indians over the past decade checking the priming on his flint lock rifle he glances at the pair of pistols holstered across the pommel of his saddle and steals his nerve his right hand slips closer to the trigger of his gun even as he makes signs for peace to the approaching indians perhaps as a terrific sense of peril gathers about him the man's racing mind brings time to stop for an instant as happens to some people during moments of extraordinary crisis perhaps the man's imagination even involuntarily reviewed the strange and exhilarating years that had passed since he left family and for tends to wander the uttermost reaches of north america's little known far west all too quickly he approaches the comanches and about twenty of them boldly encircle him a few minutes drag by while the hot still air fairly crackles with tension the indians mutter phrases in spanish that the man does not understand but he must sense that he is going to die several comanches attempt to speak ooc the strangers horse then one warrior darts out a hand to snatch at the white man's gun instantly the rifle belches forth a lead ball spilling the indian from his saddle as other comanches quickly close in the white man drops his rifle and reaches for one of the heavy holstered pistols but it is too late a second shot rings out this time from a comanches flintlock gun the white man's upper body jerks and he starts to slump from his horse long comanche lenses are thrust into him and he is dead the indians methodically sift through the man's belongings taking such gear as might be useful they mount their ponies and move on leaving the corpse where it lies never to be found in brazen silence the afternoon sun crawls toward the horizon it's raking beams illuminating the lifeless body of jedediah strong smith aged thirty two years the principal eye witnesses to smith's murder were the comanches who killed him and they never offered an account of the event still the command churros almost certainly observed smith's murder from a distance smith's companions searched in vain for two days to recover his body and if the command chairs had been discovered they probably could have led smith's companions to the site of the murder smith's fellow travelers learned nothing of his fate until after they arrive arrived at santa fe a few weeks later this recreation of an explosive instant of violence that ended the brief life of one of north america's greatest explorers is speculative but it is not merely imaginary it is based on a few skimpy reports provided by smith's companions shortly after his death scanty though it may be the documentation of the circumstances of jedediah a smith's death offers more detail than has been discovered in the records concerning his first ten years of life indeed the final third of smith's life is relatively well documented but so slim as the record of his first twenty years that any summary of it necessitates a good deal of conjecture and inference,0

B00RVZ11IC,sherman did not develop his style of warfare in a week or even a year it took the entire course of the war to change him from a commander who sought to exclude civilians from the conflict to a leader who actively searched for ways to terrorize southern civilians into giving up their cause without injuring their person in the first three years of the war sherman went from protecting southern civilians and their property to believing that these citizens were ultimately responsible for the war and had to be convinced to stop supporting it he had spent much time in the south as a us army officer and as superintendent of what later became louisiana state university he had many southern friends and thus had an attachment to the south and it's people sherman sought therefore a way to end the war with as little bloodshed as possible his entire war experience particularly as ulysses s grant subordinate provided him with battlefield savvy and tactics to do just that while sherman was in memphis and eighteen sixty two and eighteen sixty three guarding the important river town and the mississippi river he battled constantly with guerrilla and confederate cavalry units operating in mississippi and tennessee after exhausting all conventional methods for dealing with these threat it's he began to strike at the local southern towns which he considered the supply bases for the confederates by taking or destroying supplies sherman tried to prevent the confederates from sustaining the fight while simultaneously punishing the citizens for supporting the enemy although he experienced limited success with this tactic sherman believed that the key to protecting the mississippi river a major determinant of union victory was to strike at confederate resources in the magnolia state if the confederates could not find supplies they could not remain a threat to the river sherman therefore created a plan to destroy the rail lines in mississippi hoping thereof buy to cripple the state's military value to the confederacy in this manner he could remove the state from the confederacy and end the threat to the mississippi river the most important rail junction in mississippi stood at meridian near the alabama border it's rails connecting the magnolia state with the rest of the confederacy sherman and therefore chose the destruction of meridian as his main objective for the winter of eighteen sixty three sixty four the other tactics sherman employed during the meridian campaign such as the use of feints and the acquiring of supplies from the countryside were not new to war the abandonment of his own supply lines however it was an innovative idea sherman had witnessed grant's army practically perform this maneuver during the vicksburg campaign of eighteen sixty three when confederate cavalry destroyed grant's main supply depot at holly springs mississippi and damaged the mobile and ohio railroad in tennessee grant's army subsisted may mainly from food and forage gathered from farms along the railroad although grant's army had done this for only two weeks sherman and grant thought that his army could carry all necessities except food in wagons during his march to meridian and live off the mississippi countryside for the entire campaign sherman come bind all the tactics he had learned during the first three years of the war for one main purpose to remove the confederate threat to the mississippi river if the confederate threat were eliminated federal officers could remove thousands of garrison and troops along the river for use on battlefields elsewhere what sherman learned about the limitation ns of the confederacy and the southern people during his first large scale use of hard war provided him with the insight he needed to use his style of warfare on an even larger scale later sherman's method of war under grant's overall leadership became the federal strategy for winning the war for the remainder of the con inflict the union army sought to strike at all southern resources and infrastructure hoping thereby to destroy the confederacy's ability and will to keep fighting the meridian campaign was hardly the brutish purposeless destruction described in lost cause mythology rather it was a planned strategy and tactic to end the war as quickly and bloodless lee as possible thus it deserves the attention it has seldom received from historians,0
B01B8IRMY4,yeah but with the way things had been between the two of them in the months leading up to zack's disastrous climb it was impossible so tell me william said interrupting her thoughts how are things going around here without zach i know ethan is doing the the best he can and everyone is pitching in to help out but it can't be easy without zach's presence well we were kind of fortunate in that we were prepared for zach to be away for the month he was on the climb and we had done a lot of special scheduling with some of our bigger clients so nothing new was happening for the length of zack's scheduled vacation time i hate to say it was fortune in it but i suppose it worked out for the best william said thoughtfully and now it's been quite awhile since the accident surely everything hasn't been in a holding pattern gabriela shook her head everyone's been great at stepping up and taking on certain al aspects of zach's work i know ethan talks to zach every day and he's been kept up to date with what's happening but i don't think he's really engaging you know what i mean william nodded that's what has us all worried ethan can't possibly work with zach as clue mostly as needed to keep him in the loop on everything as it's happening and i'm afraid it's the only thing that might help him get out of this funk he's in he smiled at gabriela although i think funk is too mild a term he's out and out belligerent and complete lately detaching himself from everything and every one that's not good she murmured i don't understand why he's not trying harder to get better knowing zack for as long as i have i would have thought he'd be beyond anxious to get better and get back to his old self we all did he sighed that's why it's going to be devastating to have to remove him from his position in the company what gabriela cried out in disbelief what do you mean remove him he's the president of the company he started this office you can't just just replace him we don't have a choice william said we knew he was going to need time to recuperate and get well but he's not improving he's not making any effort and at the end of the day we still have a business to run obviously we'd rather run it with zach at the helm but he's given us no other option he doesn't want to work and we need someone who does it's going to kill him mr montgomery she said imploring lie you can't do it this company means the world to him william shook his head i used to think so maybe there's something more going on with him i don't know all i know is it isn't fair to make ethan take on so much he and summer have put their plans on hold for their engagement party and their vacation to see how their house in north carolina it is coming along all for zach's sake how much longer are they supposed to wait it hasn't been very long william please just give him a little more time she begged if there was one thing william excelled at it was his ability to observe people and see where they were really coming from everything in his gut was telling him what gabriela was feeling had way more to do with zach as a person than zach as her boss he just needed to be sure look at it this way considering the way though things went when you were up in alaska with zach you'll get a reprieve from all the stress and his attitude will move ethan up to president and possibly make summer the vice president if she's interested or maybe start interviewing some of the junior executives i prefer to promote note from within you won't have a big transition to make and i'm sure you'll want to stay on and help that for ethan's sake gabriela felt like she was going to be sick there was no way she could possibly wrap her head around this how could this family be so cold didn't they i understand that zack had nearly died he was struggling with his recovery for reasons none of them could understand why aren't you,1
B017XXELII,it was just as he'd expected the house was a money pit rather than being offended by his remarks she seized on his critical comment as if he'd tossed her a lifeline in fact a smile spread across her face that heart stopping smile made his blood harm in a way it hadn't for some time now it was is a good thing too it was damn cold outside moving a little faster now she stepped toward a sagging shudder and fingered at pointedly near right mr hutchinson it really would take a lot of work to fix this upright perhaps we should move on i think you'll find the other houses more suitable she glanced quickly toward his leg then away again and besides there are a lot of steps inside ken bristled at the display of sympathy she had unwittingly fueled his stubborn determination to see this house so she winced at his tone but faced him bravely you might find that troublesome i can handle the damn steps he retorted irritably he turned to look her directly in the eye ms callaghan you have a reputation as the best real estate agent in the area am i right she murmured assent that delightful pink tent bag in her cheeks again whether it was due to pleasure or embarrassment or the blasted freezing wind he couldn't be sure then you wouldn't have told me about this house unless it was something special right she evaded his gaze but it's difficult to tell if a house is right for someone until you've met them bingo so you don't think this house and i are well suited to his chagrin she didn't hesitate no she studied him worriedly sorry i didn't mean to sound rude actually i have a place in town that would be just-right she said with enthusiasm it's small completely modernized well maintained i'm sure you'd be much happier with that it would be perfect for entertaining ms callaghan i don't do a lot of entertaining her spear fritz deflated as obviously as if he'd poked a pin into a balloon oh she said now with just pretend for a moment he began in the tone he used when telling a story to his daughter met you think this house is suitable for me cut to the chase why what are its selling points she regarded him with obvious disapproval mr hutchinson buying a house isn't like investing in a stock portfolio it's not the bottom line that's important you should have a feeling for a house it should reach out to you that sounded like heresy to him ken knew quite a lot about investing and stock portfolios but he had to admit buying a house was new to him he'd figured the strategy was the same buy low and eventually sell high judging from the expression on beth callahan's face that wasn't going to work for him today he was beginning to get a vague inkling of the problem this house reaches out to you doesn't it he said throwing her own phrasing back at her she nodded suddenly looking younger and more vulnerable appealing in fact he wondered why she worked so darned hard to hide her physical attributes ridiculous isn't it she admitted with a self conscious shrug that he found downright charming and you don't want me to have the house because you want it for yourself he suggested finally understanding her dilemma no actually the houses may mine that is i bought it for resale i want to see it sold to the right people she blurted out then ground sorry i didn't mean any offence can had to admit he was intrigued by her notion of who the right people would be for this dilapidated monstrosity he normal ali didn't like wasting time on fanciful nonsense but he was in berry ridge overnight anyway and he had promised chelsea he'd come home tomorrow with pictures of their new house he was helping to spokesmen through the aasm for the move she'd been resisting from the minute he'd mentioned the possibility tell me what you see in the house he urged room by room as she listed it's attributes which were a wide stretch of anybody's imagination as far as he could tell ken began to see it through her eyes he could also begin to imagine chelsea clattering up and down the stairs sitting in the window seat upstairs on a rainy day with a book swinging from the branch of that maple tree,1
B07B4JYMF9,only then do i realize that most of those in attendance including camps parents have already made their way back to their cars only a handful are standing close by having quiet conversations meanwhile i feel stuck in place my mind a million miles away i blink the fog that settled around me the day of the accident only growing thicker with each moment that has passed since the tightness in my chest grows heavier knowing that i have to leave him here for a brief moment i ponder if i'm suffocating i struggle to pull in even the slightest amount of air and the ground feels unsteady below my feet i sway slightly feeling like i might vomit at any second but then every molecule in my body freezes the moment my gaze lands on a pair of dark eyes i know who they belong to without even looking at his face i'd know those eyes anywhere kane our gazes lock but i can't tell if he's staring at me or through me his eyes are darker than i remember his mouth set in a tight line his face expressionless he looks as empty as i feel and that thought alone is enough to have me taking my aunt carol's hand in an effort to steady my two weak legs i don't really know kane he spent four years in illinois and has traveled quite extensively since he graduated college a couple years ago hell i've only met him once in the seven years cam and i have been friends and that was at cam's highschool graduation party about four years ago and even then he wasn't very friendly i remember the way his eyes seemed to follow me everywhere that night how i felt i was going to crawl out of my skin every time i'd catch his gaze across the yard to say he put me on edge is putting it mildly not only is he intimidating as hell he's also one of the most attractive men i've ever seen up close he possesses all of the same physical qualities as cam strong jaw full lips thick dark hair only unlike cam who was flirtatious and fun loving kane is all hard lines with a deep expression that makes him look permanently put off which of course only adds to his intrigue unfortunately his pleasantries stop at his looks cam wasn't lying when he told me his brother was on the serious side i think that's giving him too much credit asshole might be the better term though i feel bad even thinking that now kane's eyes bore into mine with the heat of a thousand fires and i feel like i'm going to melt right here he knows i did this i can see it in his eyes he blames me for taking his brother away and he's right to blame me i don't know how much time passes before kane finally breaks the connection turning and walking away leaving me feeling like he's taken what little air that remained in my lungs with him i want to go after him tell him how sorry i am though i doubt it would do either of us a bit of good nothing i can say will bring came back so instead i stand here and let him walk away we should go my aunt says next to me even though i know she's right i can't seem to get my feet to move i don't know if i can i choke over my words a few tears squeaking past the concrete wall i've built behind my eyes i know how much you love him l and i know how much you wish it was you lying there and not him but i am glad it's not her words pull my gaze to hers and i'm not entirely sure how i feel about what she just said i have already lost your mother she says in way of explanation i put him there i grind out under my breath not wanting to draw attention to our conversation,1
B0733WNN9Y,so many questions but it was too loud for me to think too loud to talk while i was still on a high we went downstairs and shook our tails to the rave music blaring on the speakers when my feet felt like they were going to fall off we strolled out of the club and into the parking lot laughing like lunatics oh did he taste like sammy i need to know chloe linked her arm through mine dragging me toward the car with my free hand i lifted my long blonde strands that were sticking to my back sweaty from our dancing session the humid august night air didn't help a he tasted like cigarettes beer and one hundred percent bad boy she stepped back bounced on her toes and threw me a you're so cool look as if i were the famous one do you know what you just did in there she pointed back to the club he you kiss to hawk calvin she batted her eyelashes and the inflection in her voice took on a dreamy tone his tongue was down your throat do you know how many women would want to be you with my shaky hand i touched my lips and laughed ha i pulled the postcard from my back pocket and took in his unreadable signature i kind of wish i'd had more time than are less than five minute make out session even though i had been the one to walk away disappointment surfaced he wasn't what i'd expected what did you expect chloe smirked as she pressed the button to unlock her mercedes edo like the superhot kind no i just thought he'd have more i shrugged substance yes he was hot but i guess i had hoped for the non typical rockstar who didn't have only one thing on his mind only in my fairy tales of what were you going to pick his brain her voice turned incredulous i turned toward her smiling as a matter of fact i was i wanted to know what his inspiration was for his song death by life it was such a beautiful song that spoke about a woman who had to die to feel alive deep moving and powerful she flipped her brunette locks over her shoulder mid i roll only you sam here so odd i opened the door slipped in right next to her and laughed i'm a pastry sous chef we're all odd after she pulled out of the parking lot and veered right she braked to a halt causing me to buck forward my palm slammed against the dashboard an s u v limo had purposely stopped in front of us what the fuck she threw the car in park flew out the door and approached the black hummer limo in front of us that had dangerously cut us off before she got herself in trouble i stepped out muscles tense eyes cautious the limo was shaking from the music playing inside causing the windows to rattle what the hell is your problem she yelled stepping in front of the vehicle i tugged at her shirt chloe i said in my calm mama bear voice even though my pulse was racing she pounded at the drivers black as night window are you trying to kill people to knight opened the fuck up her tone could have cut metal my adrenaline spiked and i pulled at her arm as hard as i could i didn't want to go to jail tonight or worse be a statistic let's go i desperately tugged at her yet she wouldn't budge she was an image ocean to beat some ass and i was on a mission to stay out of trouble when the rear window rolled down she jerked back and her eyes widened my fingers flew to my parted mouth and a low gasp escaped me hawk was inside a cigarette between his lips the lips that i'd had against mine hours ago the chatter of the people partying inside his vehicle echoed through the open window he tipped his chin hey chloe blinked her face totally shell shocked and answered with a hey his eyes were on me the whole time time a dizzying current took over my body and i focused on the soft breaths leaving my mouth holy smoking hot rockstar maybe he had no substance but he most definitely made up for it with his sex appeal even if i still would,1

B00AAI5TJY,the world crashed in on him blinding light surging on waves of chaotic noise the war forged raised an arm to shield his eyes as one wall of his home swung open he stepped out holding his axe at the ready as he always did as he did even in the darkness for the world was an ump predictable beast it was always there lurking waiting to strike every noise that dripped from it oozed peril he looked about at the surrounding circle of spiteful faces and he felt a wash and blood thirsty eyes snarling mouths and angry fists he turned slowly staggering on the slanting floor searching for the one who would try to kill him someone always did thus far he had survived the assassins slain them every one at last the war forged marked him a human with long unkempt salt and pepper hair and a stew matted beard he carried a round shield in his right hand and a three headed war flail in his left a patchwork of scars served as his mail criss crossing his pale skin he was ragged breaches that came to just below his knees and simple leather shoes ill suited for combat an iron band of elegant design encircled his left arm above the biceps as thin as the human was it was surprising that the armband didn't slide off the human came closer swinging the spiked heads of his weapon in a small circle the steady centrifugal pull of the chains allowed the human to sense that position at all times which reduced the chances that a snap strike might result in an errant flail head this human has been trained to kill he thought but i have been forged for this purpose his unblinking made wrought eyes captured every nuance of the human as he closed the human was skilled perhaps even had the greatest skill but it was the rare human for whom war was ingrained as tightly as it was for a war forged positioning his large battle axe defensively he kept the aging human at bay by dodging the spiked heads of the swinging flail and allowing nothing more than a minor gouge across his expressionless metal face he backpedaled often forcing the human to use more energy to close the ground again as the battle progressed he found that he was rather familiar with his assailants battle technique he had seen it twice before demonstrated by two other humans similarly aged and armed they had not been not quite as skilled as this one but he had learned much from them he had killed them this one he would kill to he fainted forward throwing his assailant off stride forcing him to begin his assault a new the war forged made a deliberately errant strike and as he had anticipated it drew the human into a familiar pattern of blows a five swing combination that made use of the swinging chains to attack the head and each side of the torso and legs in one smooth series maximizing the momentum of the flail heads it was a dangerous combination the first time at a nearly undone him the second time he had been able to evade the worst of it but the war forged had thought about it for many long hours as in the darkness and he knew that the third time he would prevail the human executed the fourth swing the fifth and the war forged stepped into the blow with his battle axe held high he allowed the chain to wrap around his right forearm the spiked heads smashed into his armor plating then he shifted his grip on the haft of his battle axe to pin the flail heads in place locking the humans weapon with his a look of surprise crossed the humans face the wolf forged pulled and the human reflexively yanked back not wanting to lose his weapon the war forged abruptly switched from a pole to a push and the haft of his axe struck the humans squarely across the chest knocking him down the war forged released the grid of his right hand allowing the human to pull the flail off with his left he spun the great axe around and brought it up over his head then with a mighty two handed swing aimed at the center of his supine opponent he ended it the war forged yanked the heavy blade from the humans breastbone and took a moment to ensure that the blow had been lethal save for a tremor that came and left the human lay still the victorious war forged looked about at the sea of faces they were exuberant anguished relieved that none was still hateful none still looked at him he turned he went back home and the blissful darkness enclosed him,0

B00NC8XVVC,books can generally be categorized into one of three groups education entertainment or reference education books teach us entertainment books amuse us and reference books inform us this book combines education with entertainment to make it easier to recall the lesson ends by remembering the story in that sense this book is a parable a simple story illustrating important lessons from the story of the little boy who cried wolf to the story of the emperor's new clothes parables have been used to convey lessons that apply to many aspects of life similar early in this book the story is about a commodities trader but it's lessons apply to stock market and bond market investors as well as all types of business people entrepreneurs managers and ceos the moral of the story you are about to hear his success can be built upon repeated f failures when the failures aren't taken personally likewise failure can be built upon repeated successes when the successes are taken personally thomas edison failed roughly ten thousand times before finding the right filament to make an electric light bulb the day his menlo park laboratory burned to the ground a reporter asked him what he was going to do edison responded start rebuilding tomorrow in part edison succeeded because he didn't take failures or losses personally on the other hand consider henry ford who worked with and greatly admired edison ford started in nineteen o five with nothing and in fifteen years had built the largest and most profitable manufacturing firm on the planet yet a few years later this seemingly impregnable business empire was in shambles and would go on to lose money almost every year for the next two decades ford was known to stick uncompromisingly to his opinions is it possible his company lost so much money because he took the successes personally and came to think he could do no wrong personalizing successes sets people up for disastrous failure they begin to treat the successes totally as a personal reflection of their abilities rather than the result of capitalizing on a good opportunity being at the right place at the right time or even being just plain lucky they think their mere involvement in an undertaking guarantees success this phenomenon has been called many things hubris overconfidence arrogance but the way in which successes become personalized and the processes that precipitate the subsequent failure have never been clearly spelled out that is what we have set out to do this book book is a case study of the classic tale of countless entrepreneurs the risk taker who sees an opportunity the idea that clicks the intoxicating growth the errors and the collapse our case is that of a trader but as with all case studies and parables the lessons can be applied to a great many others situations these lessons will help you whether you are in the markets or in business the two areas have more in common than one might suppose warren buffett the richest man in america is quoted on the cover of forbes is nineteen ninety three edition of the four hundred richest people in america i i am a better investor because i am a businessman and i am a better businessman because i'm an investor if the elements of success can be transferred between the markets and business the elements of failure can too we could study a hypothetical series of successes to demonstrate how success becomes personalized and then how a loss follows but you are more likely to remember and learn the lessons if they are presented in anecdotes about a real person and a really big loss how big the collapse of a fifteen year career and the loss of over one million dollars in a mere seventy five days,0
B01BH0LIQ6,i served on the staff of the president john f kennedy assassination records review board a rb from august of nineteen ninety five through september of nineteen ninety eight during the final three years of it's limited four year lifespan and was promoted from a senior analyst position on the military records team to that of chief analyst for military records halfway through my tenure at the a r r b the a r r b was an independent federal agency created by the jfk records act of nineteen ninety two our mission was to locate any and all records that could reasonably be considered related to the assassination of the thirty fifth president and to ensure their d classification to the maximum extent possible as defined within our congressional mandate followed by their release and subsequent placement within a special open collection the jfk records collection at the national archives the jfk act required all agencies and branches of the government to transfer assassination records directly to the national archives in an open in full status unless there were portions of those records that an agency wanted to redact or withhold in part or in full it was the a r r b's job to define what constituted an assassination record to do all we could to ensure that agencies conducted full and honest searches for assassination records and to review those records which agencies did not want released in full at the end of the a r r b's lifespan we had reviewed about sixty thousand records that government agencies wanted partially or fully redacted our five vip board members who serve part time voted on the disposition of the sixty thousand records that were under dispute after first receiving and considering the staff recommendations and their votes essentially determined which portions of those disputed records would see the light of day agencies had to comply with the formal decisions of the a rb regarding document release and act accordingly or else appeal to the president president clinton never upheld any agency objection over any of the review board's recommendations some compromises were reached at the suggestion of the president's chief counts zl but no a r r b decision to release information was ever overturned by appeal it was a noteworthy exercise in citizen review and the a r r b went into his task with all assassination records benefiting from the presumption of full and immediate disclosure unless an allowable criterion for redaction established by the jfk records act was established the five board members overwhelmingly and routinely voted to release disputed records whenever presented with a choice unless stringent conditions for exceptions to the policy outlined in our legislative charter were met as a result of the jfk records act and the activities of the a r r b the search and enforcement arm created by the act there are now about six million pages of records related to the assassination of president john f kennedy in the jfk records collection at the national archives during my three years on the staff of the a r r b and while subsequently researching the manuscript for my five volume book inside the assassination records review board i became increasingly aware of the broad levels of conflict between president kennedy and his own national security establishment those officials within the state department the pentagon the national security council nsc and the cia who helped him to formulate and carry out the nation's foreign and military policy around the world this internal conflict over just what our nation's foreign and military policies ought to be at the height of the cold war between the united states and the soviet union commenced early in the first year of jfk his presidency and continued to escalate during the thirty four months of his administration although john f kennedy gave a robust inaugural address that seemed in the eyes of many to establish his credentials as a traditional mainstream cold warrior his ensuing behavior early in nineteen sixty one and his increasing and open skepticism throughout his first year in office toward the bellicose and in flex the old advice he was receiving from within the federal bureaucracy signalled a growing gulf between the young thirty fifth president and the national security establishment that was supposed to serve him and implement his policy decisions,0
B01NCVKNYM,maliki glanced casually back and forth along the alleyway checking for any watching eyes the electric lights of fifth avenue barely penetrated the shadows where he stood but even in human form his vision was better than the average person's he stepped back and inspected the side of the gothic rock rival mansion in front of him he'd already looked at over half a dozen times slinking down the alley in fox form at night or boldly strolling to the servants' entrance while disguised as an eyeglasses peddler during the day the windows on this side mostly opened onto servants as passages in court hers and all showed only darkness the sound of clapping hooves and the rumble of carriage wheels echoed even at this late hour but distantly there was some sort of dinner party going on further down millionaire's row but no one stirred in any of the neighboring mansions so far as mal could tell perfect sophie stood lookout near the entrance to the alley so it ought to be safe from any thief happening by any other thief that is he shimmied up the downspout with the ease of long practice until he reached the second floor window it still bore an alarm hacks guaranteed to stop any thief the ads claimed so long as said thief didn't know of the disarming phrase at least leaning close to the cold glass the mal whispered the robbed that smiles steal something from the thief he rubs himself that spends a bootleg grief the bit of shakespeare didn't make any obvious difference but unless the maid who'd given him the phrase had lied the alarm hex ought to be disarmed now a quick application of a jimmy and he was in mal paused half over the sill listening for any sounds of disturbance nothing came to his ears so he slithered the rest of the way inside and pulled the window shut behind him he removed the shoes from around his neck and nodded the laces and slipped them on one of the witches and madame gao burns pay had drawn hexes and the souls the chalk would wear off with every step so we needed to move kwa cli and directly as possible sophie had done her own bed with the maid of a frequent guest of mrs jacobs and passed along the second floor layout to mal he pictured the rough map he'd memorized earlier then hurried down the passage to a discreet door the hex shoes made no sound against the wood and the boards failed to creak beneath his weight according to sophie jacobs was storing his new acquisitions in the library while sorting through them moving on his soundless shoes mouse slipped out of the servants his passage into the main house the door hinges were oiled to silence no doubt to avoid an outburst of jacobs's infamous temper allowing now to pass like a ghost even in the dim light leaking from the street the room he found himself in took his breath away decorative woodwork covered the eggshell walls all of it gilded according to the crude maps sophie had drawn this was the petit salon the grand salon was twice the size now let himself into the hall lined with oil paintings probably worth enough to buy the whole block he lived on the door to the library stood open a crack and a thin beam of light fell through it mouth froze at the sight someone was awake after all either way he had only two choices the first was to go back the way he'd come slip outside collect sophie and try another night or he could stay see who is in there and maybe wait for them to leave holding his breath now slumped to the door pressing his eye to the crack he peered inside side the steady blue glow of hex lights showed a room whose two story high walls were lined with books most of the desks and furniture inside had been pushed back to make room for a large number of packing crates he could also see the edge of what looked like a spreading pool of blood,1
B00U697EMW,breathed a sigh of relief disaster averted she was whole again after unpacking the box and carefully laying out each precious item on the kitchen table she retrieved the other two boxes from the back seat and went through the same routine she beamed at the side of the bounties spread over the table seven more tubes of color a new studio light to get her through the winter a dozen pre stretched canvases and her favorite brush conditioner that smelled like something close to sandalwood it made the task of looking after her brushes almost soothing discovering it last year had been a treat satisfied with her unveiling of the goods she made five trips to the room she used as her studio shelving the paints she didn't need yet and getting the new lamp set up at her current workstation she played with the lcd settings for a while still dubious about the idea that she could get good color temperatures but the setting seemed sufficient nice even hm isabel crossed her arms and stared at the unfinished painting trying to decide of the daylight setting was pure enough there weren't new technological advancements in the world of oil painting very often so she'd be happy if she could get excited about this one still she'd have to work under the light for a couple of hours and see how it felt during the summer she wouldn't need it much at all this room was meant to be the great room of the cabin and windows climbed up the two story wall to the peak of the roof the windows faced south and during the summer she had good light here for nearly twelve hours of every day but during the winter there were only a few decent hours of sunlight and that was assuming the sky was clear as a matter of fact she glanced out hoping to spot an approaching break in the clouds but it was solid white out there a good time to try the lamp then it was almost too so she should force herself to grab lunch first but then she'd have hours to work her thoughts were interrupted by the heavy slide of fir against her ankle hey bear she said to the cat surprised by his affection he was an ornery twenty pounds stray who'd wandered into her cabin three years before and he didn't cuddle often he meow loudly for it attention but when she leaned down to scratch his chin he sidestepped and eyed her scornfully i suppose you just want food she asked she'd run out of wet food yesterday which was why the groceries she gasped but her heart barely managed a quick leap before she calmed it down down the bags and the su v were fine it was cold enough that she could leave them overnight and not lose anything except bananas maybe those weren't as hearty as people thought not in the cold if it were summer though yeah she'd lost hundreds of dollars of food that way over the years but this time the only bag endanger was the one on our kitchen counter she rushed to the kitchen and unpacked that bag happy to find that aside from that damp cantaloupe everything else was perfect she shoved a frozen meal into the microwave opened a can of food for bear and went to haul in the rest of the bay bags half an hour later she was organized full of chicken piccata and happily planted in front of her canvas adding a glistening highlight to a long stretch of a man's triceps glancing from the canvas to a spread of photos hung on a board next to it she nodded perfect her eyes swept down the triceps muscle to the hard knot of elbow beneath it what a beautiful line her attention twitched for a moment and isabel glared at the gleam of the light on wet paint but then she shook off the random irritation and dipped her brush and white again just the tiniest drag of paint just her hand jerked nearly touching the canvas before she pulled back what that how she snapped as she finally registered that a sound had interrupted her a loud sound the staccato knock of some stranger come to screw up her work day she wanted to ignore it it definitely wasn't jill her neighbor and the only person who dropped by unannounced jill didn't knock like that she rarely knocked at all because she knew isabel wouldn't hear it but it could be one of isabel's other friends,1
B07SBJVQ2V,fourteen years earlier my boarding school roommate was a mafia princess although i didn't learn that at first or beginning six months went by without a hiccup when i first walked into our room i took in her bedding which looked like a cloud with crystal light surrounding it the massive amount of photographs she had taped to her wall in the shape of a heart and the framed canvas with a quote in glittering font that read fairy tales happen that had been the only pause for me because i was a novice type of girl i had been shipped to hillcrest academy slightly against my wishes but also not the fighting between my parents was at an all time high and even though we lived in a mansion and they kept to their wing i could still hear them it was hard not to when i snuck up to sleep in the hallway adjacent to theirs i was an oath only child and lonely maybe not all twelve year olds have that insight but i did i also had the insight that while i loved my mother i loathed the battlefront that was in our home and my shoulders sagged in relief at the quiet in hillcrest academy on the day i moved in there had been some shrieks some giggling music playing and a mom who had shouted at a little boy who darted under my legs and took off down the hallway but none of that was really noise it would never match the shouts the yelling the sound of walls being hit and especially not that last thing i had heard two nights ago a blood curdling scream i hadn't even been in my parents' hallway when i heard it i'd been over in my wing having given up on trying to be near them but i bolted upright in my bed i'd laid back down after a few moments when no other sound followed feeling and hearing my heart pounding in my chest i wasn't altogether shocked when my dad's secretary told me the next day to start packing i was going to boarding school my dad was gone the next day my mom cried in her room the whole day i was told by claude our butler when to be ready to leave and it was only when i stood in the doorway feeling all sorts of weird and sick butterflies in my stomach that my mom came to the entryway she seemed so frail i knew she was thin but i would have that image of her that day seared into my brain forever she shuffled forward as if walking was painful wearing a sheer robe with a white nightgown beneath her feet barely peeped out from the robe but when they did i saw she wore her usual fuzzy slipper thongs they were her favorite she wore them when she got pedicures but today she also had a wrap around her hair half shielding her face the part i could see was perfectly made up with pink crystal lipstick over her mouth and her skin caked over with complexion smoother sunglasses hid her eyes i stepped into claude's side when i saw them i hadn't meant to the side of my mom wearing sunglasses wasn't unusual and it wasn't even unusual for her to wear them inside but this was my day to leave i wanted to see my mom's eyes before i went she never took them off she knelt in front of me where i was half hiding behind claude now and she opened her arms i ran to her throwing my arms around her neck i didn't care how skinny she was i wound my legs around her waist and still kneeling as she caught and held me she ran a soothing hand down my back bending to kiss my shoulder i love you my little ray of sunshine she whispered have fun at this new school make new friends she squeezed me tight claude cleared his throat opening the door behind us i pulled back reluctantly as she let me go claude already had my bags in the car he wasn't going with me to the new school my assigned car ride was with janine the secretary who told me i was leaving the day before i had no doubt she had made all the preparations for me as i walked out the door i looked over my shoulder a single tear streaked down my mother's cheek that was one of the last times i saw her,1

1488206503,something whitney's mom had been trying to make it in las vegas back then and rarely had time for actual parenting visiting her aunt and uncle here almost every summer gave whitney the sense of home she'd needed it was an escape to a magical place as far removed from wv vegas and atmosphere as it was in miles route fourteen grazed the edge of rendezvous falls whitney didn't take time to detour through the neighborhoods that led down to the water but the town hadn't changed much the houses stood out from the bucolic scenery as boldly as ever american flags waved from old fashioned lamp posts lining the streets it was still postcard pretty and indeed there was a sign proudly proclaiming voted one of america's prettiest towns a large home sat on one corner with a for sale sign in front of it it sported two round turrets and was painted black with bright orange and yellow trim whitney shook her head it looked like an homage to candy corn as a little girl the eclectic paint schemes made her feel like she'd stepped into a fairy tale where anything was possible as an adult they seemed silly indulgent impractical they were just houses now not portals to a story book wonderland because fairy tales weren't real uncomfortable confronting her own cynicism whitney pulled her shoulders back and tried to loosen her death grip on this steering wheel she wasn't here to believe in magic she was here to regroup and figure out what to do next she chewed on her lip trying to ignore the roiling of her stomach everything would be fine she just needed a plan mind back on the matter at hand she turned on the falls road and headed up the hill away from town toward false legend winery a smile played at her lips okay there was one fairy tale she believed in uncle tony had passed away almost two years is ago but until then he and aunt helen had lived a charmed life together whitney had heard that story many times too and she'd never tired of it the scrappy son of an immigrant who fell for the most beautiful girl in town despite the odds he won her heart they bought her run down farm with one of the earliest victorian houses on it and eventually turned it into a successful winery and party venue uncle tony made the wine and built whatever was needed and aunt helen was a martha stewart level hostess without that pesky trip to prison of course tony and helen's marry ej had been a statistically rare perfect partnership she turned onto lake view road which hugged the hillside instead of climbing it giving the car a welcome break whitney hadn't seen the house in almost four years her smile disappeared she hadn't come to tony's funeral her boss had made it clear at the time that leaving in the middle of the london audit for someone who wasn't immediate family would slow her progress to becoming partner she didn't know how to explain that uncle tony was the only stable male role model in her life that she loved him like a father since she'd never known her own her boss was an interested in any of that guilt poked at her before she pushed it away guilt was unproductive becoming the youngest female partner at one of the world's fastest growing accounting firms required a pricey personal toll and one of the first things she'd had to sacrifice was vacation time aunt helen and uncle tony always assured her they understood when she couldn't visit and they'd all stayed in touch with phone calls and video chats but it wasn't the same and she know it whitney recognize the rise and the road ahead and her heart jumped a little red around that curve was the re isn't this was called lake view road she didn't bother stopping at the scenic overlook that jutted out alongside the road knowing she was less than a mile from aunt helen's uncle tony used to walk down here with her from the house her soft little hand held in his huge rough one he'd tell her of the moonlit night he brought aunt helen to that very overlook to propose to her at the time whitney had hung on every word staring into her uncles warm dark eyes and wishing she would grow up to live in a place just like this with a love just like theirs but she was as an adult now and she knew the odds of that happening were,1

B0036KOEWG,in ireland my father in africa and neither of them ever lived anywhere near mansfield but they moved around a lot and came to be people who didn't have too strong a link with anywhere so i don't think the arbitrariness of the location is inappropriate besides mansfield is where the lancasters grave is my father's father and great grandparents and then back again for two more generations are all buried there his grandfather is the only immediate ancestors to be elsewhere some of the graves have been shifted over the years pushed up against the church wall to among other things make the graveyard easier to mow but the lanchester grave has been spared that and lies where it always has under the south wall of the high windowed grim eighteenth century church it's a cold place my mother said to me the day we buried my father's ashes in the summer of nineteen eighty-four a few months after his death i don't like the idea of him being cold it's where he wanted to be i said which was true i didn't and don't have the same consolation about my mother's ashes ending up but all saints i entered them there in the summer of nineteen ninety eight and it was a mistake she didn't want her ashes to go there because she didn't want to be cremated in the immediate aftermath of her death though i was so upset that he didn't read her will closely enough to notice it's very first sentence i ask that my body be buried it used to be an important piece of catholic doctrine that cremation was wrong because it prevented the bodies rising from death at the last judgment but i am not a catholic and in my distress simply missed the statement and it's importance so i entered her ashes in the summer of ninety ninety eight in the same grave where she and i had put my father's ashes fourteen years before that day the day i entered my mother's ashes i had a sense of being oppressed by things i wanted to talk about and could not the mistake i had made in having her cremated was on my conscience but since i did not know the priest had met him right there and then for the first time i felt it would be too much to explain in the fifteen or so minutes we had to whether there was also the fact not at all important but very hard to get out of my mind that the priest was wearing army boots and combat trousers under his cassock i noticed this as we stood beside the grave reading a shortened form of the burial service though doubt i wouldn't have spotted it if i hadn't already been looking down at the small hole in the grave just big enough to cover the little wooden box that contained my mother's ashes i began to wonder if it would seem out of turn to ask why he was wearing combat clones was it some new thing that priests did making some point about being soldier for christ i did hope not and he seemed a nice mild mannered gentleman not the sort for wild evangelical gestures or perhaps it was me funeral rites often have an air of strangeness and unreality about them sometimes you lose your hold on what is normal and what isn't i had a sudden vivid memory of the day after my father died when the local church of england vicar came to the door to offer comfort because my parents had only just moved into the house he had no idea who we were my mother was somewhere upstairs so i made tea in a very english way we made small talk then he picked up a photograph of my father from the bookcase i hope you don't mind me asking he said but are you jewish it was about twelve hours since my father had died i had been up all night dating with police ambulance men and the doctor i was numb to my bones so numb i didn't know quite what to say other than i don't mind you asking but no i'm not jewish oh he said pause because you look jewish pause i hope you don't mind my asking again but was your father jewish by now wondering where this was going i said no oh he said pause because he looks jewish pose because i'm jewish at this point he was visibly expecting me to break down and admit that i too was jewish but had been too shy to admit it standing by the family grave i had a flashback to that moment the church of england seemed to generate a strange force to do with eccentricity and embarrassment and nobody ever knowing quite what to say it might be perfectly normal for a church of england priests to be wearing combat clothes under his clerical outfit but i found it hard to concentrate on the words of the service there in the code yorkshire graveyard in the event the nice priest cleared things up just after putting the cloud of earth,0

B07CHTZ83W,you sure you can handle this i asked holding a training stick in the middle of a large room abigail gave me a strange look like i must be crazy to think i could beat her in one on one combat i invited you down here she said spinning the staff in her hand if you'll remember i was just being polite in case you wanted an out i said me what about you don't worry bout me sister i said with a slight smirk she can actor brow you know i'm not a nun anymore don't you once a nun always a nun i said as she raised her staff and a small spark lit up on the other end we were using electrified weapons in order to test the strength of the shield it was a safer albeit still dangerous alternative to actual gunfire a abigail banner knees and took her fighting stance giving me a slight nod i grinned okay then i said tapping the switch on my own staff sparks emitted from the ends i immediately rushed forward swinging the stick in a low sweep as i went for her legs she blocked it pushing the staff aside with a roan then twisted around and managed to strike my shoulder shield at ninety eight percent said the voice in my ear it was athena's the cognitive program in charge of tightened our present location shit i muttered noticing the blue flicker of the shield as it appeared over my body looks like the shield works said abigail stepping toward me again extending the stick towards my chest i deflected it but only barely avoiding the electrical sparks as they came within centimetres of my shield with abigail of balance i went for another strike she dodged out of the way but i wouldn't give her time to come back i swept low again knowing she'd block it holding her staff up with mine as she held it across her chest horizontally then i pushed my stick forward sliding beneath her staff and tapped her directly in the chest sparks collided with the shield as a soft blue layer appeared around her damn it she snapped ninety six per cent remaining two percent more than your head i say winking must be my man strength you're an idiot she said giving me a look i ignored her obvious jealousy makes me wonder how many bullets this thing could take she nodded should we continue until the shields drain we can test ammunition later if you'd like i responded with a thrust stabbing at her face with the stick she blocked it then tapped me in the leg for a quick hit shield at a ninety six percent i heard athena say i pushed her stick away going for a middle thrust but she deflected she pressed forward on her leg signaling her next move so i got ready for him when she launched i brushed her staff aside and grabbed hold of her arm spinning her around so she f fell across my leg she caught my wrist with her hand yanking me to the floor with her and i let go of the stick in the confusion she managed to get on my waist holding her stick above my neck about to press down i grabbed it pushing the end it lowered a few centimetres causing the shield to flicker as the wood collided with the hard light shield at seventh the six per cent said the voice in my ear give up yet asked abigail the staff continued to grind on the shield creating sparks so i stopped pushing up and started pushing sideways letting the stick fall beside me and into the floor it hit the floor next to my head with a loud pop abigail fell forward with a giver me the chance to grab her waist and turn her around we rolled until she was under me the staff beside us and her body between my knees she tried to get up but i grabbed both her hands and pin them above her head give up yet i asked echoing her earlier question god damn it she shouted squirming as she tried to get out of the arm lock i had you huh that's twice i've pinned you now i said only a few centimeters from her face if you're referring to the time we first met that one didn't count i was wearing my church garments if you'll remember she said fine but that still one to zero i jumped to my feet offering her my hand best to out of three deal she said grasping my wrist but i won't lose again as i walked back from the training area i couldn't help but observe the sheer size of this mega structure i'd come to call home i could probably fit several thousand ships the size of the renegade star inside this station although i couldn't be sure i had been here for nearly three days but still hadn't had the chance just explore much of this place it was vast and empty but still full of passages and secrets given enough time i wondered how much loot i could salvage i snickered as i passed through an open archway into another corridor this one at a guard and lining it's sides varying kinds of flowers of all colors and shapes herbs and plants gave the otherwise spartan lay out a middle life something that for the most part seemed to be lacking in other areas of titan captain came a voice from above athena instantly manifested in front of me taking me by surprise holy shit by said thrown my hand up at her say something before you go leaping out front of people like that i apologize she said bowing her head slightly although i did say captain i paused had the fancy computer program note the cognitive just given me a bit of sass just tell me what you want athena she smiled pleasantly yes sir i wanted to let you know that i have restored access to the bridge and would prefer to convene there not now i said fanning my hand i need a shower understood when you're ready captain she disappeared fading completely out of sight i continued on my way hearing laughter from further down the hall as i drew closer to the next turn,0

B07JPG1CKJ,digitisation of the homestead records has made this kind of analysis achievable on a large scale reducing our reliance on anecdotes the proof of posting notice was a brief item printed in the newspaper containing the claimant's name legal description of the land being claimed and a list of four people who agreed to testify on the the homesteaders behalf we know a key fact about these four potential witnesses they had an important social and legal connection to the entry man sufficient for the entry man to trust them to testify to the validity of his or her claim the posting thus identifies for us for confirmed and significant social and le legal connections between each homestead claimant and his or her neighbors to create the networks we used software called gephi in which we entered all four possible witnesses for each claimant for example homesteader david j caswell is linked to his four listed witnesses we called these can sections his out degree connections because they map witnesses he called upon to testify for him but of course caswell himself also served as a witness for other claimants those we term in degree connections to put this in another way in and out degree connections are like phone calls the incoming calls are people i'm asking for the favor of witnessing while the outgoing calls are for the homesteader asking others for help in degree connections are the more useful metric for identifying community leaders because they identify someone's prominence in the network based on his or her frequency of being listed as a potential witness by buy would be homesteaders caswell appears to be the only connection among his witnesses however homesteaders and other locals witnessed for each other with great frequency meaning that his witnesses had other connections that were indirect to caswell as these connections build outward from caswell the network becomes much larger and william comstock emerges as the most prominent person in the network comstock the cattle baron discussed in chapter four and later in this chapter was listed as a witness for seventeen people while caswell was listed for eight replicating this process for the remainder of the township generates a vast net the work of homesteaders and their witnesses to identify keystone individuals we selected the three persons in each township with the highest in degree connections including any third place ties out of six hundred twenty one homesteaders in the study area this process identified thirty three keystone individuals no township oops shared keystone individuals leaders stayed local tied to their land and their community much as the homestead act intended identifying keystone individuals provides us a portal through which to begin qualitative investigation into the lives of crucial leaders and ask more pointed qualitative questions,0

B075JSV87T,free and easy it may be to these gathered men but there is a quality of daredevil romance in the exploits of this group which thrills the imagination in these days when warfare has become only grim and horrible from a fourteenth of march nineteen forty one news cutting source unknown preface a good few years ago i crossed the sahara desert once from north to south and once in the other direction i did so with the benefit of a relatively modern vehicle and navigational technology decent maps and mostly generous food and water supplies i was traveling with a few good friends we a decent guide books and were often accompanied by local guides we journeyed through morocco algeria nigeria nigeria tunisia libya and one or two other african countries we did so at a time of relative peace when the desert wasn't convulsed by war and those operating in it hunted from pillar to post watched from the skies by avenging warplanes even so it was still a challenging and at times even fearful undertaking perhaps that is why for many years i've been fascinated by the story of the autumn nineteen forty two attack on boucher aerodrome in axis held libya by allied special forces the boucher raid was a spectacular mission almost without parallel and it is generally recognized as one of the most successful beat upgrades ever carried out the attackers had to navigate some one thousand nine hundred miles of the world's most inhospitable and hostile terrain in order to carry out their mission penetrating deep into the dune seas and burning wastes of the sahara the bar to raid code named operation caravan remains one of the longest if not the longer most missions in the history of special forces and epic of against all odds desert survival as i began to study the raid in more detail i asked my superlative researcher simon fowler to have a peek in the files held in the uk national archives searching for the war diary and any other official documents relating to operation caravan thankfully a reasonable body of records has survived it was in the process perusing those files that are quite extraordinary and hidden narrative began to emerge a layer of secret history underpinning the barty raid itself operation caravan was part of a larger spread of special forces missions all of which were executed on the night of the thirteenth of september nineteen forty two with varying degrees of success they involved a variety of elite units operating across much of axis held north africa the most important mission of all indeed the absolute raison d'etre for that night's audacious series of attacks was the raid onto brook and to carry off that breathtaking mission a very special unit had been formed one steeped in utmost secrecy barely a platoon in size this unit bore various names during the war but it was most commonly known as this special interrogation group or s i g the s i g s role is touched upon in some of the files held at the national archives the papers reveal how the unit part special operations executive part as a s was founded to perpetrate one of the greatest deceptions and subterfuges of the entire war sure the platoon of men who made up the scg consisted entirely of fluent german speakers who were recruited for one purpose and one purpose only to pose as a unit of german soldiers with the aim of enabling our elite warriors to penetrate the enemy's lines the airside gs were to be the masters of deception disguise and bluff and they were to use such skills to spirit the desert raiders to their targets in doing so they were to break every known rule of war on the night of the thirteenth of september nineteen forty two they were the trojan horse that took allied special forces through the series of supposedly impregnable defenses that encircled general ronald's key stronghold in north africa to brook indeed the raids on party and the other attacks of that night were but decoys d designed to blind the enemy to the real target the port fortress that was the key to victory in the desert the story of the raid on boucher is thus inextricably linked to that of the s i g and the mission to destroy to brooke during the various operations carried out that night the heroics performed were almost beyond belief or compare those recruited into the sh g in the elite forces that accompanied them knew that they were almost certainly going to their deaths they went anyway willingly all were volunteers,0
B07D5GK8VP,families and they knew mine one of them even drove me two hundred miles to pick up my puppy during the coldest snowiest winter to hit britain in twenty five years things finally felt comfortable and then i got the call to go and edit cosmopolitan now if this were a film this is the point at which this scene would pause while give you some qualifying backstory as to why this was not the idyllic scenario is it first appears cosmo was struggling his readership numbers were dwindling i opened the magazine and found very little had changed since first reading it twenty years earlier there were still agony the ants in it the same one in fact that i'd been taking advice from about what to do with a flaccid penis back in nineteen ninety there were still articles on ten ways to give blow jobs i mean seriously was anyone even giving them in two thousand and fifteen and a deeply uncomfortable looking naked male centerfold who turned out to be some guy who came fifth in the apprentice it was still a great magazine no doubt but it also need turning around and quickly the thing was i didn't know if i was the person who could do that firstly i would be replacing one of the best and most adored editors in the business a woman who i'd looked up to my entire career but one on knew the team loved like their own mother to make a real change i'd also need to do something radical and to do that i'd get people's backs up from day one everyone from the team to the hundreds of thousands of loyal cosmo readers across the globe cosmopolitan was the biggest female media brand in the world i didn't want to be the one who dug it's grave and yet forty eight hours later i decided to take the job why because i needed to be pushed i needed to feel the same frisson of nerves and tension that characterized my first few months at women's health i needed to be pushed into my discomfort zone and so there i was on my first official day in the office alone in my glass cube only a few boxes that arrived from my previous office the rest somehow lost in transit along with inexplicably my desk the only thing that made the short journey from my old office at women's health to my new office at cosmo was an enormous comedic stand up desk and i was wearing six inch heels i stood behind it my feet saw my back aching and looked out i felt ridiculous ridiculous and scared out of my mind you see my brain did not see the twenty five members of the cosmopolitan team outside my door as individuals but rather as one giant hostile mass every one of them my brain told me didn't want me there every one of them wanted me to fail but it's a funny thing the human brain it lies it looks for easy absolutes to create a scary narrative a narrative that if you're not careful will paralyze you i discovered this a few weeks previously when taking a short break before joining the magazine the hotel i was staying at had an outdoor pool it was a beautiful emerald green thing still and pretty as a mon a lily pond and every morning i vow to swim in it there was just one issue it was freezing prop awfully bone rattling the cold still every morning i would rise at the crack of dawn head down despite being bleary with sleep slip off my robe and get as far as the edge of the pool i would then dip my forefinger in with all the slow deliberation of nigella lawson lowering her index finger into a bowl of buttercream retracted it and then head back to the hotel by day three i had not completed a single lap the problem i realized was that my brain was viewing the pool as one giant ice block registering it as one long continuous struggle of course i knew that wasn't true after all thereabout five of the people in there every morning sure there would be a moment of internal struggle as i decided whether to change into my swimming costume then there would be a small amount of discomfort as i first stepped into the pool and then it would be crunch time the nasty moment of true discomfort when i had to submerge my entire body into the water her but once that was done that would be it on my final day i went to my suitcase pulled my swimsuit on without even thinking and walked purposefully down to the pool i sat on the edge and dip my foot in it was arctic still i gritted my teeth and slid it until half of my body was submerged that was the horrid part the crunch px point hanging there suspended between the searing cold water that encase my legs,0

B00YY8L9GS,early and nineteen for jean george accepted a job as the manager of the paris branch of cox's bank and that spring georgette and her family moved into amazing it on the avenue marceau it was an ideal location in the heart of the city just off the shores a d c with a view of the arc de triomphe and the twelve georgette delighted in her new surroundings with their wide open boulevards busy cafes and endless variety of things to see and do it was a marvelous time to be in paris for it was then at it's zenith as the cultural center of the world and an irresistible lure too many of the world's greatest artists thinkers writers and musicians they brought the city to life with conversation and performance art music and books and the hairs reveled in the opportunity to go about the city and absorb some of it's cultural riches for a literary francophile like george the chance to immerse himself in french society culture and language was especially satisfying while for sylvia paris represented an opportunity to rediscover her music with it's rich offering of concerts ballets private sellers and the great paris opera only the year before the hair's arrival stravinsky's ballet the rite of spring had caused one of the greatest sensations in the history of music and the city was alive with the sounds of ravel debussy and sound song whose composition sylvia remembered playing at the royal academy georges position with the bang nke his charm of manner and his fluent french brought a number of invitations and georgette sometimes went with her parents to a saddle or the theater there were also galleries museums parks and monuments to see and already an astute observer she took note of many things which she would later use in her novel helen in the book george edward recalls something of those heady paris months part of the sorry record of sixteen year old helen's first visit to paris with her father jim merchant and her governess jane pillsbury helen revels in her new home and is fascinated by the city never were more inveterate sightseers than jane and helen for over a fortnight they explored paris they walked round and round the streets which formed an outer circle about the twelve trying to decide which view of the arc was most pleasing helen thought she liked the one from the avenue marceau where you saw the all arc three quarter full and least the view from the avenue wagram they spent hours in the rue de la pe gazing at almost incredible frocks and jewels and marveled at the size of napoleon in the place vendome they crossed the river to the rv lead and the four bullets as emma and they went north to the mall matt and gasped to see the white wonder which when finished was to be the sachar they talked in exclamation marks helen said and could not find enough words to express what they felt helen attends morning school where she studies history literature and languages but the afternoons were free for amusement when they were journey down the sand on little steamboats or driver to fontainebleau there were concerts to and theatres exhibitions and picture galleries almost enthralling of all the opera many of helen's fictional experiences in paris echo her creators although georgette was to give her heroin a more peaceful departure from the city and she herself would experience conflict came unexpectedly when on saturday the first of august nineteen fourteen germany declared war and began it's advance towards the french frontier three days later germany invaded belgium and on the fourth of august britain declared war georgette and her family remained in the french capital throughout august and into september and she celebrated her twelfth birthday in paris her parents read the papers and sought information from friends and colleagues while they decided what to do like many people in those early weeks of the war they were not convinced the conflict would last but as the germans moved south and west through belgium reports of the brutality of their advance made those living in paris increasingly nervous,0
B00F2O0KO0,there was no reason captain barrington jamie morrow thought moodily as he gazed out the twist glass canopy of the dominion of man war cruiser dorians flying bridge for a spaceship to even have a flying bridge none at all there had been a reason once he knew hundreds of years years ago flying bridges had been created for ocean going vessels to provide the pilot with a three quarter view visibility when coming into dock but visibility and visual docking procedures had long since become irrelevant spacecraft out a wide array of active and passive sensor systems and docking was handled by radar laser burst and computerized transponders without any need for human involvement on top of that a vehicle designed for the vacuum of space obviously couldn't have anything that was actually open especially not a warship and yet in defiance of all apparent logic but the dorian did indeed have a flying bridge it wasn't much a little more than a five meter long half dome nestled snugly against the upper side above the main hull and just in front of the rising bulk of the number three twenty six water storage tank it even had it's own pi piloting console a helm repeater that the dorians records showed had been checked out during the warships shakedown cruise fifteen years ago and never used again the flying bridge was still manned during battle stations but it was never used so why his fellow midshipman back at the acad me had asked was it still here barrington snorted under his breath as he gazed out at the planet turning leisurely below for that matter why and how were aventine and the rest of the so called cobra world's still here by all rights they shouldn't be it had been one hundred years since these colonies had been founded out in the middle of nowhere a long and weary three months journey from the dominion through the very center of the troughs assemblage it had been nearly seventy five years since that safe passage corridor had been forcibly closed leaving the colonists to struggle on alone the general can census of the dorians officers throughout the voyage had been that the colonies must surely have died off by now and that the mission they'd been sent on was so much wasted time and effort yet here they were strong and vibrant and even reasonably populous and not only had they survived seven dec shades of being cut off from the rest of humanity but they'd apparently even made it through their own brief war against the troughs barrington scowled he'd seen some of aventine and he'd seen a lot of the capital city of capitola and he'd read a great deal about the troughs incursions into silver and adirondack back and the dominion of man a century ago cobra world's governor general mikhail ocean tower claimed that aventine had been invaded but in barron's view the virtual lack of damage to their cities made that claim suspicious the fuzziness of jintao was testimony and that of the other governmental and patroller official lrs didn't help their credibility any silt something had happened here and if it hadn't been dramatic and capital yeah it had more than made up for that elsewhere there were places in aventine so called expansion regions that had taken more serious damage and the courier ship that had visited palatine had reported similar evidence of brief occupation on celia in the world no one seemed to like to talk about there was not only serious damage to the human settlements but the wreckage of no fewer than three croft warships whether or not the incident had been an actual war it had clearly been more than just a ha heavily armed trade dispute some groups of trots had moved on the cobra world and those same troughs had been kicked right back off again the question was who exactly had done the kicking the even more crucial question was whether that situation could be recreated had the cobra worlds savior has been some other group of troughs there was testimony and evidence that at least two trough demands had been here peaceably since the invaders pulled out if there was some trough infighting going on and if that rivalry could be encouraged the dominion's mission would be a whole lot easier,0

B002V0KI7C,un had pressured the military to make a hasty judgment the artifacts in that museum had been priceless and the un had not wanted either theft or damage done as a result of the war effort it would have been awkward the museum had been booby trapped and there had not only been treasures lost but emily had ended up in the military hospital in germany with a concussion like joel she was now wary about trusting any reports of peace in any region it's been pretty peaceful so far and i just got a call that our military escort is almost here owl scowled they should have been here hours ago they were supposed to meet us before we even entered the zone that's what i told them they stopped to help remove a landmine at a village near here you'll probably run into em before you've gone far she waved get out of your owl i'll see you in kabul she watched the truck go down the hill and then lifted her gaze to the mountains of the hindu kush to the north magnificent mountains whose rough paths had been walked by alexander the great russian invaders and local war warlords they always looked austere but with those storm clouds hovering over the peaks they were particularly forbidding she turned to joel let's go back and check the cellar again we were working so fast that i didn't get a chance to examine the walls to see if there were any cubby holes where the curator might have hidden anything he followed her into the building why wouldn't he have taken anything valuable with him he might have done it the report said he'd been killed by bandits while he was trying to get out of the area but you know we found hidden artifacts before it wasn't that unusual for museum staffs to pilfer artifacts then blame warring forces come home maybe you'll find the holy grail not likely he glanced around at the empty cases of the first floor exhibition room we didn't find one display case that could have preserved anything ancient cheap very cheap i can't figure out why they even had a museum out here in the boondocks there's only a little village in the valley and that's practically deserted after all the bandit activity in the area that had puzzled emily to the area had just been opened to the un after a violent year of bandit and taliban activity it was strange that the museum had appeared to be untouched by the violence taking place around it but perhaps stranger that it existed here at all i was told the museum was funded by amanda amid a member of the national council who was born in that village he's very proud of it he was the one who requested we be sent here to save it save what i think that curator would have considered an old print of casa blanca an art treasure it was i liked that movie she was already on her way downstairs i know i'm a sentimental slob yep he said as he followed her you need someone to jar you into the real world i can't understand why you're not a cynical hard bitten shrew considering the job you do her brows rose you mean i'm not what a concession coming from you well i have to keep you in line you'd be impossible to work with if i didn't i am cynical she said quietly i just can't let it poison me there are scumbags walking this earth but there are good people too i figure if i look straight at the goal ahead maybe i won't see the ugliness she smiled as she glanced back over her shoulder and good company helps the bad medicine go down you qualify at least east seventy percent of the time ninety percent eighty five she was looking around the dim cellar it had been used as a storage area as in most museums and they had packed up everything that qualified as a possible artifact there were rusting farm tools thrown in the corner but they couldn't have been over twenty years one old and had probably been used in the garden in the back though few wooden storage boxes piled across the way had already been searched and deemed not worth transporting you check that wall i'll do this one if you see any cracks any thickness that might conceal a compartment give a shout i know the procedure joel moved toward the wall and turned on his flashlight but we're not going to find anything give it up emily your approval rating has just gone down five points be quiet and just look she didn't blame joel for being reluctant to waste time here this job had gone wrong from the time they had arrived in afghanistan they were supposed to have been sent to iraq again but had been diverted to kabul then there was the snafu with a military escort and when they arrived here the museum had been deserted and the supposedly priceless artist,0

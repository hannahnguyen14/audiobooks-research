B002V8L8KK,way to see emma and create my first disaster the evening had started fine the usual warm friendly mix of chatter and then somehow we drifted into a humongous argument i really couldn't even remember about what or why she was perfect for me she was organized pretty in a no surprises sort of way and not altogether paranoid so why had i upset her so much that she had walked out and left me to sink a surprisingly large amount of alcohol on my own i know i felt she was generally motivated by fear and i found that immensely frustrating i wanted to shake it out of her say come on forget about what other people will think just for once maybe this is why i argued with her maybe i wanted to make something give because i was kidding myself we were a couple when i knew deep down we were just a convenient distraction for each other i looked around everything was the same exactly as you'd expect everything that is except for the stupendously large hole between two buildings in the exact spot where my house used to be fuckers i said again someone stole my fucking house it happened not so much now or maybe it didn't get as much news coverage since the novelty had worn off but how stealing was inextricably part of the state culture once someone invented a means of stuffing solid matter down to one hundredth of it's size it became the crime all respectable drug gangs wanted a part of houses were generally stolen to order now for rich people who couldn't be bothered to go through that whole thing of buying furniture and spending hours lamenting over curtain colors and fretting over bathroom fittings they simply looked through one of the many catalogs that did the rounds on the dark side and put a check mark against the one they wanted then some guys came along and stole it and took it to a new location usually in another state a long way away in the old days gangs had stolen all the houses they conceivably could but then often found they couldn't shift them i'd heard of a place out in the desert in mexico where there was a scattering of new york penthouses and condos from florida they languished at odd angles to each other with no roads and no services and no one living there except a few students who went out to party now and again i always fancied going there this was definitely a moment to light up a cigarette but i fought the urge sure i could call in zone securities i could wait around for a tired cop and has seen better days uniform to come down and nod in a there's one born every minute kind of way yeah i could answer a bundle of question and but we'd both know my house was long gone when a bad thing happens it asks you who you are and if you're not sure the bad thing gets inside you it finds a place to hide and you carried around i didn't have a particularly good grip on who i was too much stuff had stirred up my head too many moments of confusion had not knocked me off course i wanted so much to tidy up the loose ends of my life and start again but they just kept unraveling as though some hidden part of me was pulling at the threads don't you hate it when this happens i said in a barely audible voice slipping the business card into my inside pocket they steal my house and they leave this if i hadn't been so pissed off i would have loved them for it i took one last look at the hole they'd sealed off the water and gas and viz media like professionals and made a decision what i quite clearly needed more than anything right now was a long island ice tea now actually what i needed were about forty six long island ice teas one after the other and i would have headed off to find them straight away if at that moment i had not been accosted by a whirlwind of old newspapers that flew at me like they were out to make some sort of point or were incensed i hadn't read them properly i battle them out of the way knowing with a sinking feeling that the approaching howl i could hear meant i was going to see something bad when i got them off my head and there it was a gafa six helicopter hovering about twenty feet off the ground not state of the art the gaffer six but tried and tested you weren't a proper gang if you didn't have a gaffe six there was a thick smell of smoke from the engine which didn't seem altogether healthy and a slick impenetrable roar from the rotors,Science Fiction & Fantasy,0.32,0.45,0.54,0.43,0.39,0.58

bred them to pull bows no human or elf could draw and the long heavy arrows ripped through horses and thick armor with savage efficiency the night marshall had watched arches dismantle more than one

B076X6SC7N,i couldn't bring myself to ring the last doorbell of the day the letters on the nameplate were illuminated from behind and burned into my retinas white this was it there weren't any other available apartments near campus if i couldn't move in here next week i'd be out on the street everything else seemed to be booked out for the start of the school year i needed this place i didn't even care that i'd be rooming with a guy because if i didn't get this place i'd have to find a pa arc bench for the start of the semester or make a cozy little home in my car whatever happened no way was i going back to lincoln nebraska never i was starting over here whatever the cost and if i had to spend a few nights in the open air so be it anything but nebraska i pressed the doorbell and waited inhaling the warm evening air i hardly noticed the pressure rising in my chest one two three inhale exhale breathe i counted to myself and squeezed my eyes shut finally the buzzer sounded to let me in i took another breath before pushing the door open mr white i didn't know his first name at that point had mentioned in his email that the apartment was on the second floor left as i set foot on the stairs i heard a door open upstairs and then the sound of muffled voices you've got my number a female voice purred someone cleared his throat and you know that i nothing serious i get it you made that perfectly clear followed buy a slurpee sound with a making out in the hallway i listened more closely before i knew it footsteps from above were approaching me on the stairway a light breeze wafted over mate and i looked up she passed me on the stairs the girl who'd left the apartment that i was about to enter she didn't seem to see me as she floated down the stairs with a blissful dreamy smile considering her reddened cheeks and tousled hair i could imagine what she'd just been up to harm man frowning i climbed the last few steps mr white was no nowhere to be seen i walked down the corridor and look to either side on my left a door stood open a crack that had to be it i pushed the door in and hesitated at the threshold the hallway was neat and i could see a few jackets hanging on the wall various sneakers if you work boots and hiking boot were lined up in a tidy row appreciatively i raised my eyebrows the shoe collection revealed eclectic interests i took the plunge crossing the threshold and entered the narrow hallway sorry dude a muted voice bellowed from the room that opened directly into the hallway have been trying forever to get her outta here without looking like an ass but some people can't take a hint wow he sounded like like a winner the voice got louder i noticed apartment showing was planned last minute but god it still worked out i heard his footsteps as he approached if you've got a girl too that's fine at least as long as mr white appeared in the doorway and it wasn't only his mouth that dropped open i gasped too the first thing i noticed was his torso his naked taut belly rippling with muscles then his tattoos i tilted my head and looked at the designs inked onto his tanned skin holy mother of god he cleared his throat and shook me out of my trance what the hell are you doing here i stared at him open mouthed he wasn't much older than i was maybe a year or two he had warm caramel colored eyes stubbly cheeks and brown hair that was longer on the top and shorter on the sides finally my voice came back we had an appointment i'm here to see the apartment we emailed my words gushed out too fast mister white cocked his head and glared at me a harper he muttered and then something seemed to click in his head why the hell didn't you sign your email with your first name i assumed you were a guy i didn't feel like explaining to him that i was still getting used to my new identity hence just the initial he let his eyes wander over my entire body for a second time his features darkened and he shook his head slowly no no i was about to retort when he repeated know what do you mean no i folded my arms in front of my chest i can pull up the email on my phone if you need proof it must have been a misunderstanding you're definitely not moving in here he said and turned away way then he disappeared into who knows where all i knew was that i hadn't even seen the damned apartment let yourself out he called back over his shoulder my mouth dropped open again the guy had actually left me standing alone in the hallway without even giving me a chance not even one word of my prepared speech the last forty eight hours had been filled with so much crap but this this pushed me over the edge i blew a fuse and stomped after mr white hey i yelled marching into what looked like a well lit cozy living room the jerk stopped mid stride and turned to face me his eyebrows knitting anger as i shouted you can't just throw me out without even showing me the place something like shock flashed through his warm brown eyes it didn't fit with his cold aura see if i can't now he crossed his arms well you can't we emailed dammit you invited me to check out the apartment so i should at least be able to see the room and have the chance to convince you that i'd be a good roommate a try not to snarl like i said there's been a misunderstanding i thought you were dude but you're definitely not he gave me another dismissive once over i'm looking for a male roommate not a female he practically spat out the word by now my rage was about to boil over the other apartment viewings had been bad but this one took the cake do you have any idea what i been through the last two days i spat and my pulse skyrocketed in one place a guy was sitting in his kitchen in his underwear his underwear and asked me my bra size in three apartments i was told that sexual favors were part of the rent in another i was told i'd have to be the nanny and twice i could barely keep my potential roommates from going at it right in front of me by now i was almost yelling but it didn't occur to me to lower my voice the avalanche was flowing full force at this point i saw rooms with walls covered in black mold i was an apartment so crammed with trash that you couldn't even see the flaw sure sometimes i couldn't even tell if i was standing on a carpet or a pile of flattened pizza boxes i was in apartments that smelled so much like pot that i could have gotten high just from breathing the air i took another step toward him and drew back my shoulders things have gotten off to a shitty start for me in woods hill dude so don't tell me to just disappear i want to see the damned rome the mistrust on his face had faded into general indifference as if i were using up his precious time and this is exactly why i don't want a woman in here he said calmly i don't need the endless whining and girly emotional stuff now adrenalin propelled me with such force that my shoulders shook maybe it hadn't been a good idea to dump my problems on this guy but sometimes i just couldn't stop until i got it all out are you done or do i have to take any more of this if the answer is yes then i'd like to dress for the occasion he continued in a flat voice his indifference only spurred me on fine i hissed turning my back walking out i could hear a phone ringing the ringtone was a song by the group fall out boy wow the jerk actually had good taste in music tears burned in my eyes as i faced the door i didn't want to go back to lincoln back to a life that was so fake and scripted my entire personality had been a facade that my mother had manipulated according to her wishes i'd only realized it about three years ago when i learned just how far she was willing to go though that day my trust in her was shattered into a thousand pieces i'd thought my mom would always protect me but instead she'd just heaped more and more lies on me until i could barely stand under their weight after that nothing was ever the same i swallowed hard and tried to banish the negative thoughts by now my hands were shaking with frustration i overheard the jerks muffled voice as he chatted with someone on the phone a few seconds later he cursed loudly again i heard his naked feet flapping on the floor as he came to the hallway,Romance,0.56,0.82,0.48,0.54,0.35,0.53

B06XHCXBZX,mentioned is the litmus test for authenticity chapter three truth lies and authenticity brings the first foundational section of the audio book to a close with an exploration of overlapping and confusing terms such as truth honesty and transparency we all think of transparency truth and honesty as being part of authentic leadership but in reality there are lots of ways of interpreting terms such as truth honesty and transparency we explore less than straightforward questions such as the value of being brutally honest if you know it is going to harm either a person or a business seeking the truth as a continual quest and being brutally honest as a behavioral choice in a specific situation that could be harmful to others the second part of the audio book the science of authenticity takes the reader on a journey through what we have learned about authenticity from the science of psychology the big insight from social psychology is that authenticity is not just one thing but a multiple component variable authenticity consists of at least four variables all of which have a chapter in this action but we begin the section with chapter four followers beware of charisma a look at how many people mistake charisma for authenticity charisma is a separate and distinct characteristic from authenticity a however most of us have been taken in at some point by someone who is very charismatic but did not turn out to be genuine in the long run the reality is that charismatic larger than life leaders may or may not be authentic this chapter outlines what team members should be on the alert for and notice in order to figure out whether or not their leader is actually genuine or just has a great show in chapter five self awareness or is it selves awareness we explore the first component of authenticity discovered in the quantitative psychological research not surprisingly self awareness is one of the components of authenticity however this chapter gets real and takes on the new notion of one consistent self that is so prevalent in ordinary business conversations the reality is that we all have multiple sides and facets which are compounded by multiple role demands common knowledge states of people behave in certain ways due to their personalities in reality much of our behavior or as determined by the situation this chapter will help the reader become more authentic by developing greater selves awareness we delve into the second component of authenticity in chapter six balanced processing and collaborative decision making balanced process things about blending your thought process with the thought processes of others without a bias toward your view nothing may be more important in today's collaborative business environment than this scale of balanced processing balanced processing is a part of good decision making as well as authenticity the construct is fully explored through the use of real world examples readers are challenged to develop their own balanced processing skills through seeking out opposing views and actually listening carefully the third component of a psychological model of authenticity is relational transparency the realities of transparency in the real world are explored in chapter seven which is titled relational transparency and honest conversations why can it be so difficult to have an honest conversation in a modern corporation about what is really happening with your project or the business as a whole the case study of alan mulally and the remarkable turnaround at ford is used as an example of the power of honest conversations the chapter also explores how the rules are changing regarding the emotional transparency that is expected of leaders about who they are as people which may not be directly relevant to business issues the times are changing quickly and the rules and expectations regarding both intellectual and emotional transparency are in a state of flux the fourth component of a psychological model of authenticity is explained in chapter eight internalized moral perspective an active unique gps system this chapter explains the terrain of moral psychology and helps the reader make sense of both moral and immoral behavior it is only through a willingness to look at our own self righteous thinking and feelings that we can actually live in accordance with our own values the chapter draws heavily on the work of jonathan height who has clarified that the morality is primarily driven by intuition and gut reactions not cognition in the third and final part of the,Business & Careers,0.28,0.2,,0.46,0.69,0.49
B00DB3TXFQ,so what is well as what we're going to talk about now contract rests on two very important core principles the first is an agreement the whole point of a contract is to have an agreement that's the free market system we we get richer we're better or more successful we're happier if we can make ww voluntary agreements with people and you know i'll give you something that's valuable to you and you'll give me back something that's valuable to me and it's gotta be voluntary this the idea of an agreement to a voluntary agreement now not all voluntary agreements though our contract we could agree the dallas cowboys are going to win the superbowl that's not a contract no one's going to sue us if they don't a contract also requires an exchange of something of value an exchange of promises or of actions a contract by definition has at least one promise and usually two to do some sort of future act and these promises are given in exchange for one another that's what a contract is all about a voluntary agreement to give a promise or an act in exchange for one of the main you'd think of a contract probably don't think of promises you think of goods and services and and money but really the contract is the promise to do those things the contract is the promise to send you goods and you promise to send me money that's the contract then you fulfill it by fulfilling your promise that's but the contract itself is usually the promise a little promise may be an act and they must be a deal the promises must be a deal for one another not given or gratuitous okay well there are generally considered to be four legal requirements for contract these are agreement consideration capacity and legality some say six some states have but will work with these four and i'm going to go into each of these four in somewhat more detail over the course of the next several lectures but i want to give you an overview right now so you have some background some understanding of where we're going the first a great requirement of a contract is an agreement which we break down in the law into an offer and an acceptance which seems like a reasonable way to have an agreement an offer and an acceptance now i suspect you all have received an offer from us some time so we may even accepted that offer what's what's an offer an offer would be would you go back bowling with me daisy mae that's the offer and the acceptance is of course baba there you have an offer and an acceptance but it's not always doesn't have to be that simple sometimes you have counteroffers sometimes you may have will you go bowling with me daisy mae and and and she doesn't say yes she says how about we go to a movie that's called a counter offer now she is the author or now bub is in the position of the ot very naked except he could say sure movie sounds good then they have a contract but instead of him doing the offering she did the offering he did the accept me or he could make a counter counter offer say something about well what if we play video games at the bowling alley or something but ultimately you have to have an offer that you can define the terms of and you have to have that accepted to have an agreement once you have an agreement you're a along part of the way to having a contract cause that's fundamental to a contract now a second requirement on contracts is what's called consideration that you think you know what consideration means right consideration means thoughtfulness kindness no no no no no this is the law consideration means scratch money laws and concerned about though thoughtfulness and kindness we are concerned about money and things of tangible value and consideration consideration is something of tangible value that has given this i make a promise to send you some videotapes those videotapes have tangible value that it's consideration you have a promise to send me in return some money that's also got tangible value and they have an exchange of consideration that's the sort of thing you need for a contract well what if i just gave you some videotapes because i'm a nice guy that wouldn't really be consideration because i'm not dealing to get anything back from me it's it's a gift it's nice but that's not how you stay in business by making people gift you have to have consideration going both ways in order to make yourself a contract at the second general acquiring the third general requirement is capacity now the soul of contract is a voluntary exchange of course and for nick,Business & Careers,,0.2,0.4,0.13,0.52,0.39
B003BF7RO8,when i was a young girl i had a teacher who used to encourage her students to drink glass after glass of milk somehow she had developed the notion that milk boosted one's intellect for this teacher a scholar by heart and by training there was nothing more precious no currency more valuable then intelligence on occasion one of us would ask her point blank what's intelligence each time she would offer a different response intelligence is a baby's first words intelligence is the joke hewn jus made in math lesson this morning intelligence it's his three brothers holding hands intelligence is yellow her responses were drivers crazy and now some thirty years later it's interesting to consider why as children we were in effect asking her to describe something for us in the most straightforward way we knew how and although she would always respond in a manner that was open and even forthcoming her actual responses would build on expressions that bore no apparent relation to what she was describing the whole thing was pretty maddening to be honest with you that said today i am inclined to be more sympathetic with my elementary school teacher over the years i've learned that description can be a delicate challenge for the describe her to the deeper you try to dig into the essence of the thing the further you have to reach to come up with the right words to do justice to what you're describing the nice thing is that it's possible to mix and match words in an infinite variety of combinations to help you do this what's tough is that when they're mixed and matched in an unexpected or overly ambitious way the rendition can become almost uninterruptible to the person on the other end as an adult i've been on both sides of this when i hear a critic describe a particular wine as somewhat challenging but with significant cerebral appeal or having a touch of menthol and green eucalyptus on the entry along with generous notes of a case the honey and vanilla on the finish i am never quite sure what i'm supposed to do with the information likewise there are few things i find is frustrating as pouring over a two thousand word review of the latest movie release only to walk away still feeling unsatisfied it's as if the reviewer got so caught up in the joys of prose that he neglected to address the reader's most fundamental questions yes the acting was industrious and the lighting nervy but was the movie any good was it worth seeing on the other hand each year about two hundred students enroll in my class if you were to ask me to characterized this group of students to you you'd probably expect me to do so along predictable lines you wouldn't expect me to tell you that they are soundproof or squeezable soft or that they need daily watering you'd expect me to tell you that they are smart witty kind or outgoing a good description is one that captures distinctiveness along dimensions that make sense to us if it doesn't do this we have no means of figuring out where to place the described entity in our heads but even though i know this i'd still be tempted to liven up my description of my students to do them better justice which would avoid eventually lead me back to the thorny issue of vocabulary when it comes to portraying something as complex as say an individual or a group of individuals that remain too many words to play with a person could be described as obnoxious quaint acerbic fragile low ashes or energetic it's the endless variety problem again this is where a uniform method of description can be useful what a uniform method of description does is put discipline around the words it creates a common ground for our characterizations by enforcing a shared set of touchpoints at the same time heading off an endless game of vocabulary mix and match consider for example one of the more popular methods of description around the standard personality test a personality test is a measurement tool designed to depict an individual's persona along a pre-determined set of dimensions ns there are obviously many variations of the test but a rudimentary one can be devised from just two fairly self explanatory dimensions dominance submissiveness and friendliness unfriendliness what's appealing about this kind of measurement tool is the extent to which it can capture a disproportionate amount of information with parsimony most personality tests involve four or five dimensions but even a crude two dimensional metric can be curiously revealing to say that some one is an unfriendly submissive iv is to say a tremendous amount about them sure you could extrapolate an additional set of descriptors eg passive aggressive sulky resentful to flesh out the complexion more fully but the nucleus of the description is there this is what a good descriptive metric does it go gets to the heart of the matter it captures the core of a characterization that could otherwise go on forever in addition it's impossible to study a two by two maps such as this one and not project yourself onto it it wouldn't take much to figure out which quadrant you belonged in similarly it wouldn't take take much to figure out where to place your friends your family members your coworkers this is the second element of a good descriptive metric it invites comparison it depicts individual distinctiveness in a way that makes it possible to see connections that were not obvious up to that point it can be oddly addictive in this regard it generates that oh this is why why george has always reminded me of richard pang of

B008AZ34AA,i was in my eighty first year it was curious to go up jordan hill road again on the slopes of mount stewart it's still the same old road rather narrow and bendy and now only considered safe for one way traffic in my days the horse-drawn cubs and milk cuts had no problem with two way operation i was the youngest of six children and enjoyed an excellent relationship with my father frank bowden who was very much the strong paternal figure it gave me a certain amount of satisfaction to be accompanied by my own eldest son on that clear sunny tasmanian winters day it's quite extraordinary really that the old weatherboard house hazeltine is still there literally as i remember leaving it more than half a century ago i don't think it's ever been painted since then not wishing to disturb whoever might be living there we took some photographs from the footpath looking down the hill past the side of the house overlooking the old square summerhouse to the steep acre paddock where mother grazed her cow and kept fouls i noticed the original three big pear trees were still there doubt plus still producing vast quantities of crisp and juicy napoleon pairs but it isn't polite to peer at someone else's house so ardently and we climbed up the three brick steps to the veranda the original wooden letters spelling out hazeltine were clinging precariously to the peeling weatherboards and knocked on the front door to explain our interest the young people living inside were quite genuinely delighted that i'd come to see the house that often wondered who'd lived there in the past as they considered it an unusual house in many ways just inside the door there was a notice board headed the hazel dean hilton with photographs and memorabilia of the people who'd room there in reese and years two of the young women flour bishop and willie wilson invited us in for a cup of coffee and some very fine hazel dean poppy seed cake now it was indeed a strange feeling for me to be there i don't know whether are transmitted the fact that i was a little moved i rather hope i didn't but the first room just inside the door to the lift was the old main living room which we used to call the dining room with it's original fireplace and same old bow window overlooking the dough and bowling green and also the summerhouse incidentally the reason why hazel dean is frozen in time is that the man who rents the house us doesn't consider it a business proposition to renovate and the next major attention paid to it will probably be by a bulldozer so the house was a nice little bit of personal history sitting there to be looked at the only alteration a very good one was to knock down the wall of what was mother's bedroom to enlarge the tiny kitchen so we had a cup of coffee and ate a poppy seed cake in mothers bedroom the house was rather small and my first memories are of sleeping in a summer house in the garden with my father and two elder brothers further on in my late teens the old man managed to build some extra rooms at the back of the house and after coffee and poppy seed cake i walked through to his bedroom i didn't mention the time that the man died in that bedroom and may died as he lived in the old man this was a happy business now i don't mean from our point of view we were absolutely gassed with grief great quote man but he came home from his office he ran a retired job as a chairman of the benevolent society and as he walked home because he didn't believe in trams much but he had pneumonia and he died and he died very quickly was three or four days but he became delirious towards the end and he was saying cheerful scenery delirium he was residing which plays a million and it was all indeed just like the young man this pretty limit i remember it was in the oh man this was a ratio of one and to see this room again and needed however i went to element it was as though he was his old self and that all came back when i stood once again in his bedroom on that july day more than sixty years on my own bedroom never looked very big when i was in it but it looked even smaller now outside the old square summer house had been shifted a little bit further down the hill from where i remember it but it was surprisingly little changed it had piling walls which didn't reach the roof,Biographies & Memoirs,0.46,0.4,0.32,0.61,0.67,0.52

B01974PY28,the prologue southern italy nineteen forty six meticulously i placed the blush on my cheek i wanted to look my best on the solemn night my husband loved to see me all dressed up and i wanted him to be pleased with me the final coat of crimson lipstick glided onto my lips and i pursed them to make sure they were smooth and wet with a wiggle i shimmied into my black rayon cocktail dress the soft fabric felt sensual gliding over my fair skin i opened the box on the floor by my vanity pulled out my red stiletto heels and slipped them on it had been years since i'd worn them or anything else so elegant the mirror revealed my dark may needed straightening after putting on the dress i brushed it up and carefully wedge the silver comb papa give me into my thick black hair to hold it in place with all i had lived through i felt older than my thirty years but i could still turn heads as i wrapped my ruby scarf around my neck i took a final look at my reflection and saw no obvious imperfections but i still felt nervous and wondered how god would see my actions on judgment day leaving the bedroom i went down the long hall stop by the bar snatched the brandy carafe and a couple of glasses and went down the stairs to the basement door the click of my heels counted out the twenty one steps at the landing i stopped to gain my composure and took a nervous little breath i'd certainly done this to quite a few men but this was my husband after unlocking the door with my free hand i entered the large basement and made sure to re it my husband sat on the couch with his back to me he didn't turn toward me when i entered which was a blessing looking around the rather stark seller i regretted that i hadn't made this living area cozy the cold stone floor needed the warmth of a rug and the cool walls had no festive paintings to allow one to escape into another place and time i set the glass and carafe on the table in front of the couch for the first time i turned toward my husband he was expressionless brandy i offered i took his lack of response as a yes and poured us each drink ever so slowly i moved towards him he didn't take the drink so i placed it next to him on the table now my gaze never retreated for my husband's handsome face with a swinging my hips i straddled him face to face i'll always protect you my prince i pulled them against me bringing his head to my bosom his chest expanded with each tranquil breath it had been years since i had felt him against me and it seemed both sweet and disturbing reflecting on our past together i drew my long silken scarf across his body and wrapped the strong cloth around his arms he didn't respond the silky fabric felt so soft and harmless i caressed his freshly shaven neck sweat my hand up to his temple and ran my fingers through his black hair now speckled with gray through the war the allied air attacks the nazis i've watched after this family while i whispered i've done everything necessary to protect it i've told you all under the seal of confession i smiled but my throat tightened as i pulled my stiletto from it's hidden sheath in my belt placing my arm across my husband's chest i said i always have and always will do what's best for you and the family i love you principi i chose to believe that the look of contentment on my husband's face acknowledged his agreement during the last four years ever since the bombing he hadn't uttered a word bird trapped within his secret world he stared vacantly into a reality i could not see i kissed his cheek even in the dim light of the basement the stiletto blade glimmered like a diamond as i brought it around and slid it into the great artery in his thigh,Biographies & Memoirs,0.68,0.63,0.84,0.5,0.25,0.5

B077XL2BMJ,chapter one miracle man the voice on the other end got straight to the point are you with your mom and dad sort of were at the mall of america but were separated right now i can find them though i'm with the transplant team at mayo and i think we have a heart for your dad my grown daughter julie's squealed out loud in the mall to what but you have to be here by seven o'clock not a minute later julie looked at her watch it was just after five o'clock she knew the drive to rochester would take an hour and a half under normal driving conditions plus we were all separated in the largest mall in the united states there was not a second to waste julie almost didn't receive the call telling us a new heart and kidney were waiting for me on march sixteenth two thousand and fourteen but more about that later throughout the years preceding my double transplant while disease ravaged my body and anguish plagued my mind i brushed against the curtain of death on multiple occasions many in the medical community told me you are truly a miracle man you should not be alive i survived when death seemed certain for a purpose you are part of my destiny you are included in god's plan i believe my story will inspire you to live fully and who you were created to be my question to you is this will you dare believe you were made for more in the early he hours of march seventeenth two thousand and fourteen i received a new heart and a new kidney these priceless gifts came from a twenty year old young man whose compassion and care for others propelled his family to continue his legacy by their decision to donate his organs i'll tell you about these amazed ing people as my story progresses while you read i trust you'll see my passion for legacy i want to leave an inheritance of hope for my family for my friends and you through my experience i learned lessons discovered renewed joy and uncovered sir secrets but i don't want to keep them to myself for now however let's get back to my story my transplant surgery took place at the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota where i experienced an otherworldly encounter prior to my organ transplants i died twice in st louis as confirmed by my physicians i'm sure there are variances in the dyeing process depending on circumstances just prior to the final breath but i know without a doubt what it feels like to pass on and let me assure you there are surprises waiting on the other side my multiple encounters with death shouldn't cause astonishment i rarely do anything the normal way when all appears lost i know from experience a greater plan is at work it seems my life is scripted by divine fingers like george bailey from the classic movie it's a wonderful life life i have been given a second chance however i did not know about george or our parallels until recently i can't say how i lived sixty six years without seeing it i missed something many embraced for decades yet less than nine months after doctors at the mayo clinic placed a new heart and kidney into my body i finally sat down with my wife linda and watched it's a wonderful life though not mirror images it didn't take long for me to see the similarities between myself and george we both had hardworking parents who embodied honesty faith and integrity he both have military champions for brothers and we are both bankers dedicated to doing our part for the greater good of our communities and the people who comprise them sometimes sacrificing self to get the job done i don't say this to brag because frankly it humbles me that i've been blessed by so many i offer you a deeper understanding by the dramatic events of my story i have truly lived a wonderful life but by human standards i shouldn't be here to share the details i grew up as the youngest of three sons my brothers are smart handsome and funny they are also my heroes joe the oldest and ten years my senior is a gifted leader when he sees a problem he immediately determines a solution and takes charge to implement it i think his placement in our birth order plus his training and experience serving in the army as an officer at the height of the vietnam conflict charted him for greatness john three and a half years older than me also fought and led great fighting men in vietnam as the middle son he exemplifies diplomacy wisdom and discretion i'm sure these qualities are why he was promoted to high ranking positions within some of our nation's most powerful yle and protective agencies because of men like joe and john we breathe the fresh air of freedom here in the united states of america i admire both of my brothers for their pivotal guidance in my life like george bailey i wouldn't be who i am today if it weren't for these relationships god provided i am deeply grateful for the ones who came before me my brothers parents grandparents and extended family members as you'll soon learn not only did they shape my life they also paved many beautiful and life altering paths for others in the regions they founded and helped maintain one some brought their traditions from a land far across ocean waves overcoming adversity leaving a mark of tenacity the invincible spirit of my ancestors flows through my veins it is most likely the reason i am alive to tell you what happened and how the events of my stories might impact you i'm also thankful for my beautiful children and grandchildren but my deepest indebtedness goes to my wife who walks by my side maybe that's why it surprised me that my family wasn't a concern as i entered heaven when i died the first time my experience was short sweet and very surprising when i left my body the transition was peaceful then comforting beyond anything i felt before or since my spirit immediately entered the supernatural world there were no white or bright lights there was no sensation of moments passing in less time than it takes to blink an eye i stood in the presence of people who had already died my thoughts swirled with emotion but nothing i sensed matched what i would have anticipated as much as i treasure my wife two sons daughter and grandchildren i would have expected my heart to ache after all i had abandoned them as i departed life on earth they are normally in my thoughts but they weren't the focus after my death instead my thoughts were focused on where i was and what i was seeing in that heavenly place i stood in the presence of people whose sweet faces consumed my attention i looked into the eyes of loved ones i hadn't thought about in a very long time people who influenced my life gaps in my memory were suddenly filled with renewed love our reunion brought complete restoration i could feel christ around in and through everything and everyone from the instant i arrived all pain was left in the past happiness like i'd never known flooded me i had made at home one of the miracles is my ability to tell you the story acts chapter

B01DPXDAZ0,i made out but had lost a tooth because of excessive sugar consumption because how could i admit that it was actually because i had an eating disorder nor did i admit to having been in an abusive relationship i didn't want anyone to think that i was an emotional wreck or a drama queen because that's what we always call a woman who has issues gateway a drama queen an attention seeker then a few months after the book came out in two thousand and fourteen i experienced a serious episode of icy day i couldn't do anything except cry and ruminate and have panic attacks i had a breakdown basically my fifth in twenty years and i'd had enough i'd had enough of the secrecy and the silence and all the fearful lying that i was fine that we will all of us always fucking fine when one in four of us will at some point absolutely not be fine one informing the number of people who experience mental health problems and if that's the case then foreign four of us probably know someone who suffers you people always politely ask when bumping into someone and i'm fine is always always the answer even when it's a bare faced lie so i decided i was not going to collude with this lie anymore i decided i was going to tell the truth and to hell if people thought i was weird or drama queen or an attention seeker if as a journalist who writes personal columns and candid books i felt i couldn't admit to these things then what hope was there for everyone aos what hope did we have in destroying the stigma attached to mental illness perhaps this sudden change of heart came about because i was now a mother and didn't want my own child to live in a world where the mentally ill are forced to exist as if everything was tickets a fucking bu perhaps it was brilliant people including ruby wax and matt haig talking about that one expert variances of depression whatever it was when i sat down to write my column in the telegraph that bleak week in january two thousand and fourteen i resolved finally to be really properly honest about myself i begin the new year by falling into a deep depression i wrote i don't mean this in a jokey way it really does happen if i'm honest it's been going on awhile but you can't write that in a column over the festive period happy christmas and by the way i'm really depressed so i've ignored it and ignored it and ignored it for as long as i could but as any the one who suffered from the black dog will know the black dog will not be ignored forever and then later when writing about going to see the gp about it the doctor's waiting room is cold and the walls are a disconcerting shade of orange like nicotine there are people coughing and sneezing while some just stare into the middle distance and i wonder if they are like me or if i am like them i wonder if they too have the disease whose only outward symptom is a jaw clamped shut through tension or frantic tapping on any available surface diseases of the mind what i would do right now for a call for a cold or even a broken leg anything but this oh god depression is so self indulgent the day the first column was published my inbox witnessed what you might term a deluge of emails of all the subjects i had written about in my career not one of them had elicited a response like this and not a single person trolled me or told me that nobody cared over the next few weeks i received hundreds and hundreds of messages from people sharing their own stories of mental illness strangers sent me cards friends i had always seen as upbeat and jolly who had probably always seen me as upbeat and jolly pulled me to one side and told me about the diseases in their own minds and i had a lightbulb moment a moment of complete clarity when i realized that far from being weird mental illness was absolutely normal so many of us experience it and yet so few of us feel able to talk about it and despite promises by politicians to take mental health as seriously as physical health it is clear that this is simply not the case as this book was being put to bed an independent commission supported by the royal college of psychiatrists and headed by a former nhs chief executive found that a lack of funding to mental health services in england was putting some of society's most vulnerable people at risk severely ill people are routinely being sent hundreds of miles away from home for cash due to a lack of available beds something their post authors pointed out that would never happen to people suffering a heart attack or a stroke campaign it has often used the broken arm analogy when trying to fight for parity between mental and physical health services why should a broken brain be treated any less seriously but the sad truth is that unless you have experienced a broken brain yourself it is very difficult to understand the urgent need for better care then there was the mental health order that came out the very day i finished this book which found that mental illness is the largest single cause of disability in this country suicides are on the rise and sufferers have been let down by the governor,Biographies &

B07PRCZFVH,well as the nation's right he proclaimed them in the first words that he addressed to the lords and principal personages of state assembled around him you all know said he what orders the late king my predecessor gave me and what he enjoined upon me with his dying breath it was chiefly to maintain my subjects catholic or protestant in each equal freedom until a council canonical general or national had decided this great dispute i promised him to perform faithfully that which he bade me and i regarded as one of my first duties to be as good as my word i have heard that some who are in my army feel scruples about remaining in my service unless i embraced the catholic religion no doubt they think me weak enough for them to imagine that they can force me thereby to obscure my religion and break my word i'm very glad to inform them here in presence of you all that i would rather this were the last day of my life than take any step which might cause me to be suspected of having dreamt of renouncing the religion that i suck in with my mother's milk before i have been better instructed by a lawful counsel to whose authority i bow in advance let him who think so ill of me get him gone as soon as he pleases i lay more store by a hundred good frenchman than by two hundred who could harbor sentiments so unworthy besides though you should abandon me i should have enough of friends left to enable me without you and to your shame with the sole assistance of their strong arms to maintain the rights of my authority but where i doomed to see myself deprived of even that assistance still the god who has preserved me from my infancy as if by his own hand to sit upon the throne will not abandon me i nothing doubt that he will uphold me where he has placed me not for the love of me but for the salvation of so many souls who pray without ceasing for his aid and for whose freedom he has deigned to make use of my arm you know that i am a frenchman and the foe of all duplicity for the seventeen years that i have been king of navarre i do not think that i have ever departed from my word i beg you to address your prayers to the lord on my behalf that he may enlighten me in my views direct my purposes blessed my endeavors and in case i commit any fault or fail in any one of my duties for i acknowledge that i am a man like any other pray him to give me grace that i may correct it and to assist me in all my goings on the fourth of august fifteen eighty nine an official manifesto of henry the fourth confirmed the ideas and words of this address on the

perhaps other plants and animals yes as industriously and deliberately as a two legged dweller might move the furniture inside a house potato he began rearranging it's own interior to create what belonged on the surface this was not easy even for an entire sentient planet with a sense of purpose the landmasses were too far to move them to the empty spot without destroying all of the other life

B002V0Q876,true bible that is the old testament two extra biblical textual material left to us by the neo babylonians the neo assyrians and the egyptians plus we will pull in the evidence from archaeology wherever and whenever appropriate and we will pay particular emphasis to the problems and to the debates that are currently embroiling the field from the biblical minimalists who deny the david and solomon ever existed to discussions about the events that took place at masada more than two thousand years ago the history of israel i'll be at ancient israel is still of relevance today i in part because men many many many people read the bible some of them read it daily and a much larger proportion know the stories that take place in the hebrew bible whether it's from childhood or from still reading them during their life today as results not only are these stories familiar to everybody but the the archaeology in the region is still pertinent every day or almost every day we read something in the newspaper in terms of recent discoveries in the land of israel or surrounding countries jordan syria lebanon and so on and so one will see stories in the media pretty much every week it or at the very least every month as a result knowing your history of ancient israel and surrounding lands will be of utmost use to you in maintaining a perspective on current events and in those cocktail parties that we all attend any attempt to teach a history of ancient israel which is what we're going to be concerned with in this course is going to depend primarily upon the biblical record and therefore i will warn you right now that we're going to take a moderate position between two extremes on the one hand there are people that say that the account in the bible is a completely accurate and adequate account of biblical times and that we can trust everything that it says on the other hand there are those people who view the bible fundamentally as a collection of folk tales miracle stories and the like and they say that the bible has no historical evidence sir to present and that we should not trust what's in it now it's true that the bible does not contain history as we would know it the word history never appears in the hebrew bible and the biblical writers are not claiming to base themselves on factual records because they are not concerned with what happened but rather what does it mean an the other hand there is an awful lot of data and the bible names of people events even dates the reconfigure out and so i am going to take a moderate position in this course and say that we can use the details in the bible provided in many cases that we can back it up and correlate with other independent sources as a historian i like to have two and hopefully three independent sources before i will agree that one particular event took place for one certain person lived and so where i can i'll be bringing in the evidence of external sources what we call extra biblical the material as well as archaeology and other data to corroborate what the hebrew bible tells us and i bring this up now because our course probably about two thirds of it is going to be concerned with events that are discussed in the hebrew bible in the old testament our first nine or ten lectures were will be concerned with this material so it is relevant to state at the outset what we will and will not be doing to place ourselves in a geographical position one thing we must realize is that the land of ancient israel and judah no one before the israelites get there as the land of canaan that's what the egyptians called it we'll get to that in a lecture or two this region is a coastal corridor it is positioned between the great empires of for most of it's history that is to the north where are the empires up in what we would call ancient mesopotamia modern day iraq and northern syria that see the assyrians and the babylonians and other people throughout time we also have peoples like the hittites in turkey down south of course we have the ads egyptians not only king types and everyone else from the new kingdom but people from even earlier the old kingdom the middle kingdom and then later in time we get the greeks and the romans in egypt and elsewhere in the ancient near east so our area of ancient israel is many,History,0.28,0.14,0.63,0.38,0.35,0.36

B0036KOG42,it would not be an exaggeration to say that i have wanted to write this book for forty years but even when i became a published author in the late eighties no publisher would have contemplated commissioning a biography of this relatively obscure woman and that remained the situation for many years until the recent explosion of interest in all things historical which inspired me to seize the chance to make my long standing secret dream come true i am truly indebted to my editors will sulking anthony whitlam and susannah porter for their support and enthusiasm for this project and to elizabeth discard who suggested that i write about katherine as well as john of gaunt the subject i originally proposed catherine swinford deserves a biography for many reasons first and foremost she was romantically linked to john of gaunt one of the most charismatic figures of the fourteenth century and their passionate and ultimately poignant love affair is both astonishing and moving catherine was clearly beautiful and desirable not to say enigmatic and intriguing and some of her contemporaries regarded her as dangerous also her existence was played out against a vivid backdrop of court life at the height of the age of chivalry and she knew most of the great figures of the epoch the renowned poet geoffrey chaucer author of the canterbury tales was her brother-in-law she lived through the hundred years war the black death and the peasants' revolt new passion loss adversity and heartbreak and survived them all triumphantly her story gives us unique insights into the life of a medieval woman yet catherine was unusual in that she did not conform to many of the conventional norms expected of women in that age and in several respects her story has relevance for us today feminist scholars are now beginning to see her from a new perspective as a woman who was an important personage in her own right a woman who in a male dominated age had remarkable opportunities made her own choices flouted convey tension and took control of her own destiny catherine was intelligent poised and talented and fortunate enough to move in circles where these qualities were valued and encouraged in women among the choices she faced were ones that would be familiar to women today although her modern counterparts would not have to endure the moral backlash that at one time rebounded on katherine and probably wrecked her life yet they would identify with her as a woman who coped brilliantly with the sweeping and sometimes devastating changes of fortune that befell her above all catherine swinford occupies an unprecedented position in the history of the english monarchy dynastic lee she is an important figure she was the mother of the buffets and through them the ancestors of the york east kings the tudors the stuarts and every other british sovereigns since a prodigious legacy for any woman without her the course of english history would have been very different writing a biography of catherine swinford poses it's own particular problems however for her voice has been silenced forever no letter survives no utterance of hairs is recorded none of her movable goods are extent and we have barely any details of the clothes she wore so we cannot determine her tastes in art literature or dress her will is lost and with it any insights it might give us into her feelings for john of gaunt her moral outlook her family relationships or her charities s she is one of the most important women in late fourteenth century england and yet so much about her is a mystery to us she is famous but paradoxically she is little known furthermore the contemporary sources to support,History,0.4,0.4,0.46,0.55,0.44,0.55

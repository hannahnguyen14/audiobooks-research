B00D2WFL2U,but candles were scarcer than food then and i don't like to use rains not oil the mingled smell of rotting fish and dialed fat wasn't a nice kind of after shave and doesn't in the chicks sadly it was that or nothing so i went with nothing since the glow had been destroyed by yours truly power was at a premium down this far in the city son was a rumor it wasn't much past noon up in the rarefied air of over trade in height and clouds and top of the world ministry lived in the sun as shielding it stealing it from us dregs that much hadn't changed yet but might never down here in under beneath the factories and warehouses of trade that were eerily silent now it might as well have been midnight even the cunning network of mirrors and twisted light well as that gave my office a shred of real actual sunlight for about three minutes around noon and an almost constant dusk for the rest of the day failed this far down i told myself that i didn't need light for what i was here for true i didn't rather what i needed was pain my pain which was a bitch but i tried everything else and everything else hadn't worked denzel was waiting and i didn't like to disappoint and not just because he's my landlord and boss he's my boss because if he concentrated he could spread me over a large portion of the city he could do it accidentally too which was more likely but i always found it best not to make him white he gets all insistent about his little obsessions and it's easiest just to go along besides i owe him a couple of legs in as without his help i probably would have blown mine off long since while i learned my magic so here i was the boy daniel was after was a downside a refugee no records no known address not even a name to go on all i had was a scrap of cloth and a hunch of dentals it was magic or nothing left to my own devices i'd have said screw the little sod and abandoned him to fend for himself no better or worse off than thousands of others quietly starving to death in the dark down here responsible isn't high on my list of qualities in fact i usually try to make sure it doesn't even appear on the list but then builds persuasive and also really good at guilt tripping me even if he doesn't mean to i hoped he would appreciate it because this was going to hurt and i don't like to hurt with my good hand i rummaged in my pocket for the scrap of cloth dental had given me there wasn't anywhere to sit that didn't involve what was probably synth tainted water the damn staff still lingered still made people sick from the inside out even now so i crouched down and leaned back against a rickety wall that i hoped would take my white i was getting better at this but still had a tendency to end up on my knees when i tried because it usually felt as though i was about to pop an eyeball or perhaps a bullock i liked the scrap of cloth on my lap and stroked it with my good hand my anchor that cloth the little bit of salmon that would help me find them in this case a boy if i didn't know someone well then i needed a prop to help me find them something of theirs usually something intimate to them on the plus side i didn't need to dislocate my thumb to power up my magic today on the minus side that was because i'd fucked up my whole left hand and the incident that had led to all the glow disappearing the hand was still healing and all i needed to do was try to make a tight fist to have white spots run in front of my eyes and power run through my veins there has to be a better way to cast a fine spell any kind of spell but i haven't figured out what it is yet when i do they'll hear the halla fuckin lulea from the top of the world all the way down to the bottom of the pit i might have fist and pain spiked through me along with magic sweet and alluring and oh so dangerous it spun around me through me calling always calling in and out quick as i could that was the best way before it tempted me before the black rushed up to claim me i'd beaten the black before once but i wasn't so sure i could do it again it was always there waiting to trap the unwary seductive and tempting the price of my magic wasn't a pain,1

B00CPO8TBQ,the ominous cloud swirled heavily about the dark shapes that moved silently forward in the night a cold autumn wind blew torrents of rain into their faces and icy water trickled down through the gaps in their ragged cloaks it froze into slush on their shoulders but they did not complain a flash of lightning briefly illuminated the scene and revealed hundreds of axe blades and spears pointing upward and beneath the cloaks thousands of cruel red glowing eyes yeah the mist wall was on the move again and these creatures of the darkness felt not the cold for they were filled once more with the fire of victory an enormous warhorse plodded among the figures and it's rider loomed above the others in the freezing blackness screen was happy more than merely happy he was ecstatic his thin blood coursed rapidly through his veins his body quivering with the anticipation of a child awaiting a present he could feel the song victory building at the back of his throat death and destruction stretched in all directions as far as the eye could see even in the cold and rain blood saturated the ground and the anguished cries of the dying rang in his ears like the crew pistol notes of some glorious song torrents of black rain pelted the miserable defenders of the village of cairngorm those few who were unfortunate enough to still be alive and a layer of freezing sleet coated the forms of the dead who would never rise again their swords still clenched in their lifeless hands cole old steel trampled into the bloody frozen mud the battle was in it's final stages and none of cairngorm would survive in the distance could be heard sporadic sounds of battle where screens minions those hideous battalions of orcs goblins and other unspeakable creatures were eradicating the last bits of human resistance around them all came the missed wall a sinuous curtain of writhing vapor that swallowed forever whatever and whomever it encompassed the village and also castle cairngorm had been valiantly defended by it's loyal citizens but thanks to the workings of screen their magic protection was gone and the defense was now hopeless soon all would be enveloped by the mist wall screen rose in his stirrups there was another flash of lightning and the huge magician was startled to see a small group of mounted knights charging down upon him from a nearby hill in what seemed like slow motion screen reached under his frost covered for cloak pulled out a compact ebony wand and pointed it in the direction of the impending attack it's almost too easy murmured the magician to himself with a smile the sound of thundering hooves was now clearly audible above the din of battle and the noise of the storm the screen uttered a rhyming incantation just as another flash revealed the nights almost upon him a small ball of fire flew off the tip of the wand and grew into a massive roaring flame which enveloped the unfortunate horsemen before they could strike when the smoke and fire had cleared the few dazed survivors vanished under a solid wave of axe wielding goblins the second battle of cairngorm was over and done the miserable village and those who had died defending it were now but a memory swelling the mist wall to slightly greater proportions and extending it's black border of death screen nodded to himself and stroked his blonde beard which had grown in nicely following his fiery encounter with the sorceress elizabeth of moria were it not for her and her meddling cohorts this worthless village would have been his long ago now it's conquest gave him a satisfaction all out of proportion to it's real importance in the grand scheme of things,1

B00CHRW9BW,my eyes fell on the writing desk on it's leather covered surface i could see a little pamphlet with a reproduction of a mercator map on it's cover i can recognize another dealer's catalog at twenty paces even in semi darkness i made my way over and picked up the list of an old business acquaintance who operates from a country house no what though i hadn't realized it before so many miles from here the cover said general literature winter nineteen ninety three to four and somebody had tucked a letter away inside shamelessly i peeked dear mr waring i am pleased to offer you the sum of six thousand pounds for my chew choice of one thousand volumes it was just what helen had said i wondered whether this particular offer had been accepted and if so just what good stuff might have gone at the bargain rate of six pounds of volume while all book dealers have blind spots and it was still worth discovering what he might have missed but i didn't expect much but the family needed the money and looking is always fun slowly i circled the room early twentieth century novels worth checking for first editions though mostly without dust jackets gardening books always interesting local history it's shelf much depleted but even so there might still be two or three thousand books here and there had to be something worthwhile then i realized there was the carpet i'm no expert but the floor was covered by a big flowered rug not worn it was certainly hon som pattern with a cream center pale green borders pink roses was it authentic it was and like everything else in here but if by any chance it was genuine surely it would fetch quite a bit at auction i walked around the arm chairs finding no obvious signs of wear in front of them and some one had had the sense to protect the area in front of the hearth from sparks because a big cause looking olive green rug about eight feet by by six had been laid on top of it there then it occurred to me that it could have been put down to hide burn damage my intentions were casually altruistic when i walked over and flipped up the corner of the rug with my foot what i saw made me catch my breath take hold of the end of the rug and pull it back a jacket section had been cut out of the hopper song roughly six feet wide and three or four deep i couldn't believe this the edges of the cut were irregular as though somebody had slashed and hacked in a frenzy it took me a full minute to realize what i was seeing and then i peered gingerly at the floorboards they were spotless the old man could have been standing in the doorway for several minutes before i noticed him thinning longish white hair curiously dead eyes a sagging square face above a plump body in an old taught and dressing gown with striped pajama legs and carpet slippers below he was standing very still watching me do i know you i got hold of myself and explained my name is dido hoare i'm lizzie's friend we were here for lunch and i'm having a look at your library i'm an antiquarian book dealer he nodded then immediately he looked at the great hall light uncover in his library carpet he frowned slowly and looked up again i thought i heard him mumble where have you put peter rabbit and then he asked more loudly who did you say you are,0
B00KCV18IK,bonus material the shortcut to shoe analogy surprise i'm still here and the value just keeps on coming you can kind of think of this like the bonus material you get when you buy a dvd collection isn't that just another reason to prove that movies are better than books i mean when was the last time that you got bonus material and a book if anyone has ever told you that flipping to the back of the book before you're done is cheating well congratulations because they're wrong and you're right good job on flipping to the back of the book you now know that there is a bonus chapter that isn't listed in the table of contents and you're getting to the gist of my stuff faster and more efficiently than all the chumps who are still reading what i want to give you here is kind of like like an abstract of my book as i've already told you unless you skipped forward and mr point that i made in chapter one and honestly that is kind of lazy this book of mine is the only one i have ever read cover to cover so i am sensitive to the fact that you might have some hdd or trouble with reading comprehension if that's the case i don't want you to totally miss the the big takeaways from my story in fact there's this app for people like me and you who need abstracts of books and i think it's genius that being said i don't want some chimp scanning through my book and giving you the abstract i want to give it to you myself but since this is the only book i've read and now i've read it like at least ten times because my editors kept making me reread it i am not reading it again that probably means you're not going to get a neatly ordered list of bullet points that correspond to chapters i'm just giving you the broad strokes which i hope came through my story somewhere in all these chapters technically then this isn't a true abstract if you don't like it well that's not my problem he should have read the book cover to cover in the first place this is the shortcut i'm giving you shoe intelligence that is how to think like shoe money think with your mind and not your heart the dumbest business mistakes i have ever made were because i did them from the heart i have gone into business with other comes bunnies sold equity in my business for pennies on the dollar and given lots of cash to colleagues because i was trying to be a hero to people who didn't care i like my heart i have a good one but in business my mind is always the thing to consult don't take advice from anyone who has not done what you are trying to do you are going to get tons of the advice throughout life the keyword you need to listen for when any one is spouting off are here is what i did in a similar situation i listened to what everyone has to say but in my experience see what i did there i will take advice from someone who has already been where i'm headed prioritize that advice above the other fifty thousand people who might have good ideas but haven't been where you want to go if you see an angle take it down immediately i always thought i had a special gift for seeing unique ways to do things i call them angles the truth is that lots of people see angles very few have the balls to exploit them and almost no one does it fast enough thirty seconds of awkwardness can pay dividends for life don't be shy to ask for a picture with a celebrity don't be embarrassed to use everything you have access to for leverage if you are afraid of looking silly or stupid you need to have a few near death experiences and stop taking yourself so seriously get what you can and then use what you got what don't underestimate what you bring to the table you are smart you have expertise in some area whatever you've been doing you've been getting better at it every day no one sees the world like you do so someone out there will want to pick your brain let them but set a price whatever you know your time and information are even more valuable if you put a price an it business minds have unlimited amounts of money for anything that will give them a positive return on their investment if you have been successful in an area that someone else needs to know about why give it away they will pay i promise you my going rate is ten thousand dollars per each four hour session i book that constantly now maybe you'll reconsider going back and reading through the book more carefully do the math and think about what a deal you've just gotten i mean i didn't charge you even close to ten grand for this time right you never get in trouble for what you do you always get in trouble for what you say i bend the lines morally legally and ethically so i know how it is i'm no judge but let me just tell you this much if you are doing something sketchy keep your cards close to your chest at all times never put into an e-mail or in writing which you can talk about out over the phone trust no one i'll stop there on this one always stand up for yourself when i was a kid i never back down from a fight as it turned out i got beat up a lot but any one knew that if he came at me you were going to get hit back and i got a lot of looks in for sure,0

B00XZFEZVM,don't come to them any more than one spouse can simply choose another each also has to be chosen often there is a structured matchmaking environment some kind of application and selection process through which that courtship and choosing takes place those matching processes are and how well we navigate them determined some of the most important turning points in our lives and many smaller ones to matching dictates not only who gets admitted to the best colleges but also which students get into the most popular courses and which ones live in the best dorms after college it determines who lands the best jobs and who has the best opportunities for advancement matching sometimes is the gatekeeper of life itself as when it determines which desperately ill patients receive scarce organs for transplant even if matches are made in heaven they are found in marketplaces and markets like love stories begin with desires marketplaces help shape and satisfy those desires bringing together buyers and sellers students and teachers job seekers and those looking to hire and even sometimes those looking for love until recently economists often passed quickly over matching and focused primarily on commodity markets in which prices alone determine who gets what in a commodity market you decide what you want and if you can't afford it you get it when buying one hundred shares of a t and t on then new york stock exchange you didn't worry about whether the seller will pick you you don't have to submit an application or engage in any kind of courtship likewise the seller doesn't have to pitch himself to you the price does all the work bringing the two of you together at the price at which supply equals demand on the n y se the price decides who gets what but in matching markets prices don't work that way going to college can be costly and not everyone can afford it but that isn't because colleges raised tuition until only as many students can afford to attend as the college can accommodate that is until demand equals supply on the contrary selective colleges high priced as they are try to keep the tuition low enough so that many students would like to attend and then they admit a fraction of those who apply and colleges can't just choose their students they have to woo them to offering tours fancy facilities financial aid and scholarships since many students are admitted to more than one school similarly many employers don't reduce wages until just enough desperate job hunters remain to fill their ranks they want the most qualified and committed employees not the cheapest ones in the working world courtship often goes both ways with employers offering good salaries perks and prospects for advancement and applicants signaling their passion credentials and drive college admissions and labour markets are more than a little like courtship and mare marriage each is a two sided matching market that involves searching and wooing on both sides a market involves matching whenever price isn't the only determinant of who gets what some matches don't use money at all kidney transplants cost a lot but cash doesn't decide who gets a kidney in fact it's illegal to buy or sell kidneys for transplantation similarly airport landing slots involve fees but that isn't what determines who gets them access to public education also isn't priced taxpayers support schools precisely so that every child can can attend for free many people would find it repugnant to allow money to decide who gets a kidney or a seat in a sought after public kindergarten when there aren't enough kidneys to go around and there aren't or seats in the best public schools there never are scarce resources must be allocated by some kind of of matching process market design sometimes a matching process whether formal or ad hoc evolves over time but sometimes especially recently it is designed the new economics of market design brings science to matchmaking and to markets generally that's what this book is about along with a handful of colleagues around the world,0
B002V5H3AW,the random house audio presents the mostly harmless the douglas adams the the anything that happens happens anything that in happening causes something else to happen the causes something else to happen the anything that in happening causes itself to happen again happens again the it doesn't necessarily do it in chronological order the chapter one the history of the galaxy has got a little muddled for a number of reasons partly because those who are trying to keep track of it have got a little muddled but also because some very muddling things have been happening anyway one of the problems has to do with the speed of light and the difficulties involved in trying to exceed it you come nothing travels faster than the speed of light with the possible exception of bad news which obeys it's own special laws the hinge free old people of arc into four minor did try to build spaceships that were powered by bad news but they didn't work particularly well and were so extremely unwelcome whenever they arrived anywhere that there wasn't really any point in being there so by and large the peoples of the galaxy tended to languish in their own local models and the history of the galaxy itself was for a long time largely cosmological which is not to say that people weren't trying they tried sending of fleets of spaceships to do battle or business in distant parts but these usually took thousands of years to get anywhere by the time they eventually arrived other forms of travel had been discovered which made use of hyperspace to circumvent the speed of light so that whatever path battles it was that the slower than light fleets had been sent to fight had already been taken care of centuries earlier by the time they actually got there this didn't of course deter their crews from wanting to fight the battles anyway they were trained they were ready there are a couple of thousand year sleep that come a long way to do a tough job and by zach while they were going to do it this was when the first major models of galactic history set in with battles continually rerouting centuries after the issues that had been fought over had supposedly been settled however these models were as nothing to the ones which historians had to try and unravel once time travel was discovered and battles started pre erupting one hundred of years before the issues even arose when the infinite improbability drive arrived and whole planet started turning unexpectedly into banana fruitcake the great history faculty of the university of mexico magallon finally gave up closed itself down and surrendered it's buildings to the rapidly growing joint faculty of divinity and water polo which had been after them for years which is all very well of course but it almost certainly means that no one will ever know for sure where for instance the gremlins came from or exactly what it was they wanted and this is a pity because if anybody had known anything about them it is just possible that a most terrible coteau dystrophy would have been averted or at least would have had to find a different way to happen click hum the huge gray grubby alone reconnaissance ship moved silently through the black void it was traveling at fabulous breathtaking speed yet appeared against the glimmering background of a billion distant stars to be moving not at all it was just one dark speck frozen against an inch definite granularity of brilliant night on board the ship everything was as it had been for millennia deeply dark and silent click hum at least almost everything click click hum click and click hum click hum click click click click click hum hmm a low level supervising program woke up a slightly higher level supervising program deep in the ship's semi somnolent cyber brain and reported to it that whenever it went click all it got was a hum the higher level supervising program asked it what it was supposed to get and the low level supervising programs said that it couldn't remember exactly but thought it was probably more of a sort of distant satisfied sigh wasn't it it didn't know what this hum was click hum click hum that was all it was getting the higher level supervising program considered this and didn't like it it also low level supervising program what exactly it was supervising and the low level supervising programs that it couldn't remember that either just that it was something that was meant to go click sigh every ten years or so which usually happened without fail it had tried to consult it's era lookup table but couldn't find it which was what had alerted the higher level supervising program to the problem the high level supervising program went to consult one of it's own lookup tables to find out what the low level supervising program was meant to be supervising it couldn't find a lookup table odd it looked again all it got was an error message he tried to look up the error message in its error message lookup table and couldn't find that either it allowed a couple of nanoseconds to go by while it went through all this again then it woke up it sector function supervisor the sector function supervisor hit him immediate problems it called it supervising agent which hit problems to within a few millionths of a second virtual circuits that had laid dormant some for years some for centuries were flaring into life throughout the ship something somewhere had gone terribly wrong but none of the supervising programs could tell what it was at every level vital instructions were missing and the instructions about what to do in the event of discovering the vital instructions were missing were also missing small modules of software agents searched through the logical pathways grouping consulting regrouping they quickly established at the show chip's memory all the way back to its central mission module was in tatters no amount of interrogation could determine what it was that had happened even the central mission module itself seemed to be damaged this made the whole problem very simple to deal with replaced the central mission module there was another one and a backup an exact duplicate of the original it had to be physically replaced because for safety reasons there was no link whatsoever between the original and it's backup once the central mission module was replaced it could itself supervise the reconstruction of the rest of the system in every detail and all would be well robots were instructed to bring the backup central mission module from the shielded strong room where they guarded it to the ship's logic chamber for installation this involved a lengthy exchange of emergency codes and protocols as the robots interrogated the agents as to the authenticity of the instructions at last the robots were satisfied find that all procedures were correct they unpacked a backup central mission module from it's storage housing carried out of the storage chamber fell out of the ship and went spinning off into the void this provided the first major clue as to what it was that was wrong further investigation quickly established what it was that had happy and a meteorite had knocked a large hole in the ship the ship had not previously detected this because the meteorite had neatly knocked out that part of the ship's processing equipment which was supposed to detect if a ship had been hit by a meteorite the first thing to do was to try to seal up the hole this turned out to be impossible because the ship's sensors couldn't see that there was a hole at the supervisors which should have said that the sensors weren't working properly were working properly and kept saying that the sensors were fine the ship could only deduce the existence of the hole from the fact that the robots had clearly fallen out of it taking it spare brain which would have enabled it to see the hole with them the ship tried to think intelligently about this failed and then blanked out completely for a bit he didn't realize it had blank now of course because of headline doubt it was merely surprised to see the stars jump after the third time the stars jumped the ship finally realized that it must be blanking out and that it was time to take some serious disk asians it relaxed then it realized it hadn't actually taken the serious decisions yet and panicked it blanked out again for a bit when he awoke again it sealed all the bulkheads around where it knew the unseen hole must be it clearly hadn't got to it's destination yet it thought fitfully but since it no longer had the faintest idea where it's destination was or how to reach it there seemed to be little point in continuing it consulted what tiny scraps of instructions it could

B079NL6P2H,on a night in late summer on a beach somewhere along the pacific coast of south america bro hermia and emilia sat together in the sweltering heat with their feet dug into the cool wet sand watching the waves crest in the moonlight as usual amelia was drinking from a bone flask full of something that smelled slightly of coconut and strongly of alcohol bro home here however had nothing he hadn't eaten or drunk anything in days in preparation for tonight now that they were finally on the threshold though he found he was having trouble asking his sister to begin you don't have to do this now amelia said quietly her amber eyes shining in the dark you said it was centuries in the future a lot can happen between now and then there is no shame in waiting no help either romeo replied digging his hands into the sand but i see the vision every night now amelia there is no escaping it i have to do something his sister took another sip of her flask what do you see she'd asked him before he told her before but while bro whom you're desperately didn't want to talk about it he could never deny emilia anything i'm in a ruined city he said quietly tilting his head back to look up at the endless stars above them at least i think it's a city it's so big i can't be sure the buildings look as tall as mountains the future is full of marvels amelia replied with a chuckle too bad it gets racked she frowned was it one of us i don't know bro mir said the death vision isn't like my others there is no path of decisions no trails to follow it's just a moment sliced in time i don't even know how i got there but he's already waiting for me he could see it perfectly even now the black reach stood over him a long black shadow silhouetted by the strange orange light shining from something unseen behind him he kills me after that if that's all it is we'll just have to make sure i'm there to amelia said proudly the black reaches the death of sears not the death of amelia's i won't let him touch you but you are there bro mir said i can't see you in the vision but i can smell you close by there is another hard striker as well one of our brothers which one he shrugged helplessly i don't know his back is to me so i can't see his face i don't actually think he's been born yet bro mere smiled he strikes me as very young amelia snorted so useless not useless the seer said the vision is only for a moment but in that moment i know he's important may be the most important he can't be that important amelia said bitterly the black wreak still kills you he does bro amir said voice shaking he kills me amelia i see it happen over and over but what's truly terrifying is that my death isn't actually the worst part what's worse than dying he took a shuddering breath the thing in the sky his sister scowled but bro whom he didn't know how else to explain it there were no words no names from what he'd witnessed floating above the scene of his death but every time bro him your side fear cuts straight to his bones it was even worse than when the black reach cut him down that was merely the end of him,1

B07BSYVCD4,take your time then meet me on the front porch swing porch swing you put me on that after all the food and wine and you'll have to pinch me to keep me awake and i'd love to kendall said winking at her and piper heard her laugh when she slammed the door on her piper hurried not wanting to waste time time and when she opened the door again the house was deadly silent more paintings hung in the short hallway to the foyer and as she walked past the front parlor and looked out the large bank of windows she saw kindles sitting outside above kendall's head to the left the sudden movement of a squirrel running across the branch drew her eyes up and the image in her peripheral vision made her stop the portrait over the mantle made her quit breathing and she put her hand on the doorframe to keep from swaying the woman was a reflection of piper herself captured in oil paint she didn't remember moving but she walked only to the middle of the room the sight of her smiling twins scared her because her expression was so lifelike her eyes seemed to follow and draw piper in she didn't turn away from it when she sensed kendall join her she didn't need to break their silence yet to ask who this was because hill had done such a great job describing the long lost love who drove jacques from his home angelina dupont why didn't you tell me she asked not as an accusation you would have thought me mad and i really don't know why you look so much alike you just do kendall we don't look alike our faces are exactly the same you're your own person piper and you two have differences your eyes are darker she was a tad taller but it doesn't matter you're both beautiful women in the hearts of those who care about you to think otherwise would be to disrespect you as individuals i didn't tell you because it's not important merely coincidence are he sure is she why you didn't want to see me anymore i am not her if that's what you're worried about i understand she was set to marry jacques and she died this isn't history repeating itself she glanced back at kendall and felt like she was in a strange dream the same thing won't happen to us even if you talk about her like you knew her i'm not sure sure sometimes we can all learn from our past mistakes do you want to know how angelina died the priest we talked to wasn't very forthcoming your family has done a great job of sharing only the history you want the world to know kendall dropped into one of the chairs in the room and peered past piper's shoulders to the painting hanging there at the time very few knew exactly what transpired the last night angelina and tomas spent in this house and you're wrong history can most certainly repeat itself i didn't want to see you again simply because i wanted to keep you safe and kendall that was close to three three hundred years ago don't let fear cloud what's in your heart our time together should prove how much i care about what happens to you and that i'm not punishing you by sending you far away from me kendall looked at her with glassy eyes piper you've got to leave here today and never come back i couldn't handle any harm i'm coming to you or your family because of me i don't want to walk away from you she said sitting next to kendall i can't know how jacques lost angelina but i'm sure the same thing won't happen again don't throw this away before those seedlings had the chance to sprout with a shaking hand kindle reached at cross for when a piper's listened carefully i wasn't lying when i told you i was here on family business i remember everything you've said but what does that have to do with people who lived a long time ago angelina died at the hands of jacques' brother because of an old rivalry that went too far my brother is brought me to the city and it would seem that history is repeating itself i don't want to drag you into the middle of that so please as my friend do what i'm asking you think he's that dangerous more than one reseller we ever thought to be and he'll use whatever and whoever he can to get to me i'll sacrifice anything but for i let him touch you what if i want to help you you know to return the favor for saving grandad in me i love you watching my back but please just work hard to make more modest success and forget you ever met me,0
B07NW5JNZY,in twenty seventeen i had the pleasure and privilege of judging and presenting an award for startup businesses within the food and drink sector accompany from the purpose-driven business category was unanimously voted the winner by the judging panel the winning business not only humbled me but reduced me to tears at the award ceremony change please based in london is a coffee business setting up mobile coffee shack selling cups of fairly traded coffee to busy commuters where this business is making a real difference is in training the homeless from the streets of london as barristers and employing them to serve coffee in these mobile stations the company also find some suitable housing change plays is a for profit business but is changing communities both locally and in the parts of the world from which they buy their coffee through their ethical sourcing policy as part of the judging process i taught one of the newly trained baristas a former drug addict and rough sleeper and was left with no doubt that his life had been completely transformed by this mission driven company change plays is one of a number of a new generation of businesses including my own cotswold fair that are redefining the way business is done in order to make a positive difference in the world both through the way they treat their people and those in their supply chain and through their environmental policies profit is still very much a motivating factor for these purpose-driven businesses but is absolutely never prioritized over people or planet the realization that businesses could potentially make a more significant positive difference in the world than charitable organizations came to me while i myself was engaged in the charitable sector i form my company purely as a way of paying some bills and helping to feed my children to subsidize a low income i soon realized though that through my embryonic business i have the ability and resources to change the world for good more quickly than through my charitable endeavors i hadn't planned for life in business it was a happy accident i ended up running a purpose-driven business twenty years ago as you will discover just to be clear i'm not saying that charitable and faith organizations are wasting their time far from it many of them have had a hugely significant positive effect on the world however much charitable work is crisis management repairing damaged the people and our planet some of which is caused by the lack of stewardship of businesses within industrialized countries the power and resources to change the world for better in a proactive manner are potentially greater within the business sector than anywhere else excitingly much of this potential has yet to be realized let's start by defining what i mean by purpose-driven business on purpose business for purpose business or mission-driven business all different expressions with a similar meaning i will use all four terms interchangeably throughout this book the starting point for anyone running or engaging with this type of beer business is that they believe there is too much injustice in the world too much of rich poor divide and too much damage being done to the environment their leaders want to use their business as part of the solution rather than being part of the problem those who are happy with the current state of the world and think that nothing needs to change may be best at this point to pass this spoke to someone else in my experience however most people agree that change is required and doing business in a better way is essential for the world to be transformed into a better place for the seven point five billion people who live here compared to the previous hundred years at least in the twenty first century business can be done in a better way for the people within our companies better for those people outside our companies and better for the planet there is a new awareness and desire within commerce to start businesses that benefit the world and it's people rather than take from it i believe that we are on the cusp of a movement that will redefine capitalism a movement that has as its aim to take people all over the world out of poverty a movement of businesses run by leaders who want to give to the world rather than take from it there will be more boards of directors who measure their success not by shareholder plaudits or dividends but by how many lives have been changed for the better,0
B07RPPGJW1,rank oberman high priest of chatters reach stood at the window of his opulent apartment shivering in the night time cold he wore the black robes lead plated chain wooden sandals leather armbands green sash and bronze plated headpiece afforded his exalted position but given the amount of time it took him to get dressed every day he sometimes wished he taken up some other calling like acting the headpiece was fashioned from a single cast with mounting holes around the base intended in less enlightened times to literally screw the heavy device to the where his skull it was supposed to mark the high priest at in a crowd something it achieved with huge degree of success given the headpiece evoked an oversized pair of rabbit ears one of them tilted forward to give the impression the wearer was listening intently the origins of the device were lost in the mists of time but apparently a miserly king of the era had sacked all the proofreaders in the land declaring them a waste of money so why the emotion came before the high chamber instead of suggesting a headpiece that would lend an air of gravitas to the high priest it instead recommended a headpiece which would lend him a hair of gravitas repercussions of the king's unwise move were not limited to funny headgear indeed the monarch's tomb slowly crumbling with the passing ears still bore his subjects well meaning epitaph here lies king typo beloved of all may he rest with angles ironically burial custom of the time required that kings and queens be entered in a sitting position so the epitaph was more accurate than even the high chamber intended armaments shivered again there was no glass in the window which wasn't surprising because panes of glass hadn't been invented yet and thus a strong salt light embryo he's cut through his ornate robes as though they were fashioned from gauze he gathered the robes tighter trying in vain to warm his bones and looked out onto the city his suite was on the top floor of a converted bell tower the bells were long since gone melted down to forge weapons for some long forgotten war and the view from the window was breathtaking torches and lanterns flickered in the darkness below the dim glow barely illuminating the streets and alleys further in the distance he could see the first of the city walls were moving specks of light revealed the gods patrolling the battlements he'd often wondered whether that was wise since it gave a concert shield enemies something to aim a bow at but he'd been assured that statistically speaking they lost fewer gods to occasional arrows than they did from god's taking a wrong turn in the darkness and plunging to their deaths so the lights stayed there was a rustle of bedsheets behind him an album and smiled the last warming his bed had being particularly vigorous as promised and he decided she would receive her second tip of the night when she left album and shivered again and was about to turn away from the window and engage in more warming pursuits when he happened to glance down into the town square an elaborate wooden stage being constructed in the center with lanterns hung from polls illuminating the large chopping block which had been brought up from the cells for tomorrow's executions the timbers of the stage were fresh and raw but the chopping block was streaked with dried blood black and foreboding in the darkness the lanterns would be taken down at dawn the polls ready to receive the new and far more grizzly the decoration as each execution took place the woman said suddenly interrupting his somber thoughts i thought this kind of thing was banned for priests album and knew what she meant but he shrugged off the question it is not written so that the teachings of zephyr clearly state that foreign nation do you presume to lecture the high priest on such matters i've got a copy of the wind fast said the woman doggedly and i can read is that so album and turned to face her she was sitting up in bed naked to the waist and with a sudden stirring he'd realized she'd probably get more and two tips that eve which tradition do you possess i not know do i just got half the pages missing but the bit about priests is pretty specific does it mention magic perchance the woman gasped her chest moving in a most alluring fashion as she raised one hand to her mouth album and said i thought so you have an early edition position of which could lead to your arrest he gestured towards the window half the people decorating those polls tomorrow will be executed because of a similar crime,1

tightened like a steel cable muscles straining against his purposely too tight twill shirt he contemplated isabel's words knowing the appropriate response but unable to reply lights beat down on him accenting the white of the bald eagle on the united states circular seal at his feet he leaned back and touch the wood of the resolute desk dramatically i can't gavin shook his head turning away from

indian eyes we've been over this gavin you need to talk to tracy if you want to make changes i'm not pissing him off again remember this is the sharknado of alien dramas don't overthink it gavin walked toward the monitor stepping past the camera from the carpeted oval office set to the concrete of the soundstage a thick cologne fog hung around bellamy like a physical barrier gavin leaned close to the man despite his body spray reek of just saying we can change the line and still have it get the cheese factor across without being delivered have a pointlessly sexist just say the line is written baller the voice came from behind one of the aria lexa cameras gavin knew who it was before he saw the man i was promised you wouldn't be on set gavin said turning toward executive producer tracy cummings as he walked over to bellamy the man thrust out his chest arrogantly but his thinning hair and paunchy torso belied any physical authority he wanted to display the hawaiian style shirt didn't help either gavin stood a full head taller than tracy and lord it over the shorter man with some enjoyment tracy didn't back off this is my production and i won't have you throwing your weight around like you did on nowhere but down gavin pointed to isabel still standing in the fake oval office but now engrossed on her phone if izzy supposed to be the vice president she would never allow the leader of the free world through your like his own personal plaything it's demeaning have you ever known a vp that was a twenty nine year old victoria's secrets model this isn't reality baller tracy said almost standing on his tiptoes to meet gavin's gaze you think i'm muscle bound guy like you with hair to his shoulders would ever be president you're not marlon brando and this isn't a streetcar named desire do your job and go home this is the last time i do a cameo as a favor gavin looked at bellamy we only have two more days of shooting gav bellamy soothed walking from behind the monitor and placing his hand on gavin's shoulder the sting of powerful body spray assaulted his eyes look you want to be out of here by six for your birthday party so i'll tell you what let's run through it a few more times with the line width from the script as it is and then i'll give you a few pass has some good tracy snorted roughly pointing from the two men to himself you can do what you want but i have final say at the end of the day bellamy's teeth shine behind a counterfeit smile eyes darting between the two powerful men gavin nodded massaging his scalp through his long dark hair he understood the director's predicament step between an a lister and the most destructive executive producer in hollywood fine gavin said let's get this done excellent back to one bellamy shouted let's earn some green people tracy shouted i need another plane gavin's fist balled and voluntarily he could see the variety headline baller punches executive producer he let out a frustrated breath and stepped back over to the desk and his beautiful co-star cameras cued up bellamy yell to start and isabel dutifully delivered her irony soaked lines mr president i think it's time you grabbed that rocket launcher and showed these alien bastards they invaded the wrong planet let's kick some martian ass gavin said eyes burning with the fury of a man about to slaughter an alien race he picked up a shotgun from the desk and cockpit grabbing isabel to his chest and kissing her passionately on the lips oh mister president she demurred i chose use my vice president for a reason gavin cringed he knew people would laugh in theaters but felt the entire thing reeked of lowest common denominator sexist tripe he wanted to throw the shock and isabel after her line and say let's get presidential still cheesy dialogue that would make people laugh but eliminated the overtly demeaning interplay they ran through the scene a handful more times as tracy watched from over bellamy shoulder until finally gavin got his chance to change things around bellamy let him shift the scene how he wanted but gavin knew tracey would never allow the footage to see the light of day,1
B00DCCBNGI,sorry for me to do that since you've obviously already invested in this course so you're going to have to listen to me anyway but bear with me for a moment because i think there are some important things to be said look around yourselves right now and think about the impact of science and technology on the modern world right now you're listening to my voice and perhaps seeing my image through a technology that is commonplace use it every day but sixty years ago was completely unknown science and technology allows us on a daily basis to zoom around the surface of our planet at breakneck speeds even to fly through the heir to it's furthest corners scientific information now beams down invisibly and silently to us from the depths of space from machines that we've built and launched into voyages to distant planets nowadays we know about all kinds of things or maybe we flatter ourselves into thinking that we know about all kinds of things such as the birth and the death of stars to the invisible sub microscopic rearrangements of the molecules going on within our bodies at every moment we look to science with varying degrees of confidence to solve our problems around the globe right at this moment tens or hundreds of thousands of scientists are busily engaged in a wide variety of projects expending millions of hours billions of dollars while thousands of students are eagerly training to join their ranks at every moment science and technology impacts on our lives in so many levels we literally cannot escape it any longer and that itself is a remarkable but indeed a bit of a frightening thought as well well i don't need to go any further in this in this way what i would urge you to do is maybe spend the rest of today making a mental note of every time your life depends upon science and technology and you can be surprised at how much of science and technology directs things in f fact i think it's no exaggeration to say that science and technology are very high on a very short list of the most important factors influencing even directing our lives as individuals and as a culture well if this is so doesn't it seem essential to understand the background to our current scientifically based society how and why did things turn out this way were there other options how are things different or the same in earlier time periods indifferent civilizations how we when and by whom were scientific discoveries made and more importantly why were they made what are the ways in which science and society have interacted well it's questions like these that undergird the entire enterprise of the history of science know the history of science is actually a fairly young discipline it's professionalization dates only from the twentieth century and the founders of the discipline seeing how important science and technology was to the development of human culture realized that traditional history which traditionally focuses on economic political military social factors might infer fact the missing a very important dimension and explanatory principle to account for the historical development of culture so we come now to a beguilingly simple questions many simple questions are what is science if we're going to study for the next eighteen hours something called the history of science perhaps it would be a good idea to have more or less have an idea what science actually is now i think if i were to ask people you would all have more or less of an idea of what science is some sort of a definition but the definitions that we give to something like that are automatically determined by our own experiences and of course anything that is close to us whether that's physically or temporarily always looms the largest therefore our definition of science is going to be a definition of modern science the definitions we give will be drawn from features familiar to us in current day science we might point to the use of mathematical models mathematical tools to a more or less way well defined scientific method or something having to do with precision or methods of proof or certainty what you see here's where the problem arises those features may not in fact be essential to science science as we know it might have turned,0
B0095P85US,i knew right from the moment i opened brand's back room door this job was going to be trouble see here's how it should go bren waiting alone with a package on the table and my advance payment in his hand simple and no surprises so when i saw bren waiting not alone and no package on the table i got a little twitchy my first thought was that bren had crossed someone he shouldn't and sold me out as well but the stranger in the room didn't look like a guardsman or even some way one's freelance enforcer he was young well dressed and nervous which settled me somewhat as other possibilities became more likely maybe a younger son of a wealthy family hawk deep in gambling debts brand sometimes worked as a collector didn't matter though whatever the stranger was here for i wanted no part of it i'll come back later i started to shut the door brand caught my eye and motioned me in dev just the young man i was looking for his deep voice said the annoyingly cheerful tone he used on high cider customers he'd even dug out a major light in place of the battered oil lamp that usually perched in the corner the brighter harsher light from the faceted crystal sphere only highlighted the cracks in the adobe walls and the wax stains on the table i took a few steps into the room but left the door open at my back who's he then i jerked my head at the stranger glaring at bren i don't like surprises when i'm in the city they never turn out well shut the door and i'll fill you in bran ignored my ob obvious displeasure and waited patiently the stranger shifted on his feet but didn't say anything eventually as bren had known it would my curiosity got the better of me i shut the door but didn't come any farther into the room i still wanted to be near an exit brands lined brown face creased in a satisfied smile dev this is kieran he's looking for passage over the white fire mountains to cost i told him you were the best most discreet guide i know and you know the mountains like nobody else you can take them along on the usual run i choked back the first thing that came to mind which was along the lines of you've got to be fucking kidding me but didn't bother to keep my feelings off my face i hadn't missed his emphasis on the word discreet for several years now i'd run packages across the mountains and over the aloft the and border to the city of cost for him the law fins were strict as hell on magic piling on all kinds of laws and regulations to try and stop people from using it except in the tame little ways approved by their council human nature being what it is is that makes for a thriving trade in certain specialty items and since they'd outlawed all the darker more powerful kinds of magic it wasn't too hard to get around the poor bastard of an a lothian major stuck with border inspection duty easy money as far as i i was concerned but smuggling a few illegal charms and wards was one thing smuggling a person was a whole different story one corner of brins wide mouth corked yeah he'd seen when i was thinking i know you're a busy man dev but i promise this will be worth your while the pay's very generous very and what man couldn't use an extra windfall this time i kept my face blank although inside i was furious he knew then gods all damn this city nothing stays secret here for long but i'd hoped for a few days grace before word spread of the disastrous end to my partnership with gela we'd only split yesterday that meant bren must have asked after me special and he must have known he'd need extra leverage to get someone to take this job worse he had it on a platter damn his eyes i needed money and badly,1
B0093LRJE2,look veto i need your help or something i'm taking a lot of heat from certain members of my cabinet and the military regarding our secretary of state i joined in you mean little g the president smiled yes veto little g the president moved to a small bar in the corner of the room and asked if i wanted a drink i told him i'd have whatever he was drinking he made me some drink with one of those umbrellas in it that you'd get in a chinese restaurant i drank it and didn't complain even though the drink tasted like stale vodka and sour tom collins mix vito gerald is perceived as weak in meetings with foreign leaders not only physically weak but he's not showing the backbone needed in verbal banter with our allies and potential enemies i remember you from sixth grade through high school you always protected gerald from bullies would you do that for me here on a much larger stage so let me get this straight you want me to sit in on meetings with world leaders and make sure gerald doesn't get taken advantage of basically yes vito i've had you completely checked out you passed the series seven exam and became a stockbroker a successful one at that then you gave it all up to do what you loved repairing and restoring vintage cars veto i know you can do this all i want you to do is to add a physical presence for the united states at these meetings play it by ear don't embarrass gerald just back him up somehow i'll leave the method up to you i'm tired of being pushed around in these international negotiations my administration is considered weak on foreign policy i'm counting on you to help change that image i asked the president of gerald know about this plan of his his raised eyebrow followed by a quick comment we'll figure out something to tell him was less than reassuring to me however the president of the united states had asked me a favor and i wasn't about to turn him down,1
B07HN9QX8G,yes life batters us whether we are rich or poor public or private my wound is like a slow silent hemorrhage of the soul on the outside i look as if i've got my act together but i encounter those dark stormy days when i feel very small very fragile and very frightened as if i might shatter into a thousand pieces and break into heart rending sobs at something as simple as a how are you this is my life i came into the world on april seventh nineteen thirty two in rural kentucky during the darkest most desperate times in american history this was three years into the great depression history reminds us that farmers were struggling with low prices for their products going bankrupt and losing their farms the weather was even against them the dirty thirties were known for dust storms insects summer heat and winter cold the national unemployment rate was twenty five per cent from nineteen twenty two nineteen thirty two there was a fifty per cent drop in household income nationwide farmers especially young people were losing hope and moving away because of the grinding poverty and shaw shattered family relations schools were shortening their days are closing their doors by nineteen thirty five of ten million high school age americans four million were out of school twenty five thousand teenagers boys and girls were riding the rails a turn describing the desperate and dangerous practice of hopping aboard freight trains to leave the family farm in search of a paying job it was a terrible way to live recalled a fifteen year old who rode the rails for three years it was rough and dangerous but there was also a mystical quality not knowing what tomorrow would bring i have moments of real terror when i think we may be losing this generation said first lady eleanor roosevelt who made that era's youth problem her personal crusade another way teenagers and young adults were getting away from home was by taking the gamble to start their own families even when they were not able to support themselves such was the case of my parents i have been told that at age twenty my father dillard witty more a muscular dark haired lad with sad brown eyes and an olive complexion was working his parents farm when he was charmed by a flirty petit hard working neighbor girl fifteen year old margaret maggie ledger to day they would be considered children themselves however in that era and in their circumstances they were surely more or mature than people their age in later generations they were married april first nineteen twenty nine in clay county kentucky i wonder what hopes and dreams they could have had at that dark time in our history it must have been a universal thought that life cannot get any worse first i want to believe there was a good chemistry between mother and dad and that they were in love i am told that i was named after my paternal great grandmother emily marie witty moore whom i never knew there are many things and people i may be new or should remember but do not in fact only disjointed piece of those painful years as a farmer small child exist in my memory trying to re inhabit my childhood seems impossible i've moved through so many decades all the time trying to block past memories there is one image that by divine providence is wholly preserved and is with me today even after over seven decades of neglect the second grade photograph of little emily you see on the cover of this book her clear eyes have not faded and seemed to be urging me to sharpen my memories for her sake discovering little emily has motivated me to find answers to questions i should have asked in my childhood emily serves as a crutch learning about someone else not me but we are one and the same,0

B00BJOJTGW,the fiery light of the wicker man fell on the man on the litter his robe was also worn and bloodstained though he wore armor beneath the cloth the metal was battered and pierced his face was lined with age his hair white his lifeless eyes were staring straight up at the stars above the complex they passed through had been built in state ages in the center where they were headed were five pairs of stones arranged in a horseshoe each pair consisted of two large upright stones with a little stone laid horizontally on top a slab of sandstone was placed at the midpoint of the entire complex to act as a focal point for worship and an altar for the various local religions that had flourished briefly before b being swept under by the weight of the years later builders had constructed a second smaller ring around us using spotted dolomite and even later a third encircling ring thirty meters in diameter was built of sandstone blocks called sarsen stones there had even been a fourth circle of wooden stakes surrounding the entire complex stonehenge had reached it's peak week around eleven hundred bc with all stones in the three circles in place along the wooden forth then came the romans who desecrated the site rightly believing that it was a focal point for local shamans whose power they sought to destroy much as arthur had tried over fifteen hundred years later the romans tore down some of the lintel stones and even may managed to tip over a few of the upright ones they burned the wooden outer circle much as the druids now burn those whom they had condemned the original centrepieces however had resisted all efforts at damage over the centuries the woman led the horse and litter up to the oldest set of stones two uprights covered by a little stone she threw back her head hood revealing lined skin and grey hair shot through with some remaining black with arthritic hands she untied the litter from the horse we waited too long my love and we became too noticeable she whispered to her partner in a language no one else on the face of the planet would have understood it had not yet really sunk into her that he he could not hear and never would hear her again she noted the direction of his dead gaze and she too peered upward for a moment searching among the stars she pointed there my dear god my he had been known as gawain at arthur's court and had fought at the battle of camelon were both leaders mortally wounded each other it was there he received the wounds that had drained the life from his body as she traveled as quickly as possible to bring him here however it was not the wounds to his body or even his death that frightened her it was the damage to an artifact he wore on a chain around his neck underneath the armor it was shaped in the form of two hands and arms spread upward and worship with nobody a mighty blow from excalibur wielded by arthur just prior to his final confrontation with mordred had smashed through the armor and severed the artifact in half af a tremor passed through her body at the site and two she had held in for the week of travel burst forth an earthquake of fear and sorrow threatened to overwhelm her she could hear the chanting and see the flickering fire to the north and knew she did not have time to wallow in her pain before the druids came here to worship what they could not comprehend she she ran her hands lightly over the surface of the left upright stone searching after a moment she found what she was looking for and pressed her right hand against the spot she had located for a moment it seemed as if even the chanting of the druids and the screams of the dying halted all was still then the outline of a door appeared in the stone it slid open she unhooked the litter from the horse and grabbed the two poles with effort beyond the capability of her aged body she pulled it into the darkness beyond freed of it's burden and smelling the foul air the horse bolted away into the darkness the door immediately shut behind them the outline disappeared and all was as it had been a week later stonehenge was abandoned where the wicker man had been there was only cold ash with a scattering of blackened bone the druids had gone back to the hills hiding from the brigands who roamed the land so it had been for centuries so it continued the stones had seen many invaders many worshipers and they would see more in the future the sky was grey and a light rain was falling blown about by a stiff breeze in the middle of the megalithic arrangement the outline of the doorway reappeared on the left standing stone of the center pair it slid open and one person appeared garbed in black robes noting the rain the figure pulled back her hood would she resembled the old woman who had first entered but fifty years younger instead of age withered flesh her face was smooth and pink her hair was cold black she turned her face upward allowing the rainfall on it the falling water mixed with the rivulets of tears on her face she had tried and failed as she had fear you'd walk my was truly dead after all the use they had been together she reached,1
B002V8KWT8,and profitable work really is a possibility you've already taken an important step toward re awakening the dreams and passions you haven't had in years or might never have had at all all of a sudden complacency and comfortable misery become intolerable the idea of putting your calling on the shelf becomes intolerable not only do we have the opportunity we have the responsibility to spend our working hours in work that will elevate us to our highest calling and transform the world around us no more mondays will show you that meaningful work really is within your grasp it will help you recapture that childlike creativity you may have lost it may release the dreams and sense of purpose you had as a child you may find your prayers invigorated now knowing there is a dated by day application of god's design for your life and once you've opened the door and seen all the exciting career operates unity's that await you whether you decide to revolutionize your current job or launch a new career altogether you'll find you can't go back to the old way of working it's like you've banned to life some dying embers ignited a new flame of possibility that inner light of your childhood imagination might have been due dimmed by your adult notions of work but this book will help you rekindle it again so that you can get a real sense of all the possibilities available to you we can find ways to express our hopes and dreams in our daily work while i certainly don't advocate confusing who we are with what we do i believe that our work can be our best gift to ourselves our friends and family our communities and the best expression of our purpose here on earth given the amount of time we spend working failure to find meaningful significant work is not just a minor misstep and living out god's plan is it's a deeper kind of failure that can make each day feel like living death it's no surprise that we often choose to dismiss work's importance by reducing it to a necessary evil that merely provides a paycheck but as long as we view work as simply something we have to do to pay the bills we keep ours selves from embracing our talents and gifts from recognizing our visions dreams and passions fulfilling work work that integrates our talents and our passions work done for a worthy purpose has always been a sign of inner and outer maturity and wisdom and there is an even more urgent need to seek out more meaningful work in today's fast changing world we can no longer afford to simply show up at work punch a clock and expect payment for our time in fact we put ourselves at tremendous risk if we do many of us have been raised to think that all we need to do to achieve success and sick purity is finish school get a job with the right company put in thirty five years or so and wait for that proverbial gold watch but those days are over never to return in today's volatile workplace the average job last a mere three point two years companies are dismantling pension plans cutting health insurance benefits and replacing the gold watch with a pink slip so has the workplace become a hostile environment of all the good opportunities disappeared have we been doomed to lives of financial mediocrity and soul crushing work conditions the answer to each of these questions is a resounding no but the work place has changed and we need to change along with it we need to change the way we think about our jobs about work hours and salaries and about job security as we witness the destruction of the old work model is it possible to imagine a new model that is more than just drudgery three boredom and a paycheck that's never enough the answer to that is an enthusiastic yes everywhere you look you'll find new and exciting opportunities keep in mind however they are a lot different from the choices of previous generations i've had the privilege of experiencing these changes first hand so i know how scary and intimidating they may seem at first the future that was presented to me when i was a young boy was a lot different from the varied but exciting path i have taken if i had followed the career path my parents laid out for me there's a strong possibility that today i dread mondays and despise my daily work as many of you do breaking away from the life expected to me was not easy in fact it caused a severe breach in my relationship with my parents as walking away from the work work also meant leaving my family's religious culture but i'm forever grateful that i did not foresee,0
B00BFZDH7M,the fun has gone out of etiquette this is not what the late great emily post intended she was writing about society with a special emphasis on new york society and her observations were witty and sometimes barbed she considered new york the epicenter of rudeness and wrote about it back in nineteen twenty two now new york's bad manners are often condemned and often very deservedly even though the cause is carelessness rather than intentional differences the indifference is no less actual and the rudeness inexcusable her pointed insights sprinkled liberally throughout her book etiquette in society in business and politics and at home can't help but bring a smile to all but the most jaded emily portrays all types of boorish characters that are parties and luncheons noting their manners violations with our literary eye but handling them with her trademark humor and forbearance almost a century later these villains of rudeness are recognizable to me modern readers from encounters in their daily lives underlying emily's devastating wit was always superb advice for getting along with others and bringing civilization to society the intention of this book is to fast forward the clock and shift the focus to the society or lack thereof that you will find it today's america can workplace here are three hundred one smart answers to any tough questions you might have about comporting yourself with dignity and poise with your workmates bosses clients and customers inside learn the up to the nanosecond rules for engagement in the twenty first century whether you find yourself brainstorming around a conference room table breaking bread at a business banquet or glued to your computer screen communicating with a team three thousand miles away you'll learn how wielding superb manners can help you impress your boss make peace with your underlings silence your dissenters and annihilate your competition with kindness so that you can stay at your job indifference to emily post splice spirit the second aim of this book is to bring the joy back to etiquette becoming an office diplomat should and can be fun in the current climate of job scarcity likable considerate classy people are the ones who get ahead and this book look with the ghost of emily post as it's guiding spirit is poised to show you how to become one of them,0
B00J488YHA,whenever a new person comes into the world the gods wreath and dhaka hold their breaths they fear the ones who do not know who they are to become for whenever one of these is born the gods come close to death these are the persons who when offered the choice between wreath and dhaka between female and male are most likely to choose neither and whenever there is someone who does not accept the gods within herself then the gods die a little and so the gods hold their breath at every birth who will this one be look at her the infant is an adult going through a process the child is a lesson that the future one is learning cherish not the child so much as the adult she will become tried to see the person she will be start with respect for the moment of her birth let her enter this world gently so that she will not be frightened by this new place in which she finds herself this will set the pattern for a life if she is born not knowing fear she will not be frightened later on in life by all the other new things she will encounter birth is not a mother's moment it may seem that way but it is not her triumph it is the new persons we have not met the new one but it is her needs that predominate think of her she exists only in the present she has no past and knows no future she is timeless she is a tethered linked to some wondrous unknown person messiah or thief we have no way of knowing unnumbered years along the path but at this moment no now she is only small defenseless a victim of events birth is her universe an explosion of her universe it happens and what is not self begins to take shape we must not separate this person from her oneness with the universe too forcefully or she will never feel part of it again and yet it is all too easy to do just that she exists only as a moment of sensation easily terrified because she has no memories against which to measure now every sensation is new and if it is intense it will be difficult to assimilate it will imprint as pain and all similar sensations ever after or resonate with that memory there is no way to warn the small core of future someone's past of what is about to happen there is no way to prepare her beyond the natural ways of mother wreath but those alone should be enough if we listen to the guidance that the goddess has given us in our hearts perhaps there should be a better way to come into the world than one that is fraught with so much possible pain and fear and terror but perhaps there also is no better way for a person to be born than to come from the belly of another it is the most intimate of all relationships forging a bond of caring and interdependence between the two that will be as long as life the new person will need someone to reassure her while she is discovering how best to become herself to reaffirm that all her options are valid and that all experiments even the failures are necessary if learning and discovery are to occur the birth mother is entrusted with that mission and it is not a mission to be taken lightly we must not accept responsibility for another person's life unless we are also willing to accept the burden of her pain else we injure not just the adult to his child we hold within our bodies but the gods as well we cherish our small persons because we want to believe that they are parts of us but let us put aside our own needs for the moment and consider her needs first let the new one be a person for herself before she has to be a part of someone else's identity these small innocent ones are gone gullible they have an eager willingness to accept what we will do to them they believe that what they see and hear us do is the way of all the world the only way they believe it because they have not yet learned there is an otherwise let us not damage them in shortness born of their acceptance for in truth we damage our future selves so let us learn from our children and let us not be too certain of our truth let us always question it for only in questions is the growth of wisdom,1
B07LCXXPD4,he looked at her in understanding as they both leaned into their horses' hooves clattering over the stone cobbles they reached the outer gate the guards looked at them in stunned horror you're not going out there cloth looked at eyelid she looked at the guard we are once we're through bar it again and leave if if we don't make it to where we're going we won't be coming back the guard opened the gate as one she and cloth set themselves leaned into their horses and shot at a gallop from the gate high above from the steps of the castle alon watched them go as they raced out of the shadow of the walls of the castle both crouched low over their horses it suddenly occurred to him that he he hadn't told cloth that islet wasn't fully settled into her magic yet the magic that would protect her an icy ball of fear settled around his heart he willed them to go faster as if that had been the signal that was a tremendous roar from those massed on the hillsides the voices of hundreds of troy souls and goblins the flood crusted and rolled toward them two small figures raced across the plane a troupe of trolls and goblins broke off from the main mass and rode to intercept isla saw them out of the corner of her eye she looked at colac he nodded he'd seen them to the rift appear weird to be growing larger as they approached but the trolls drew closer as well both drew their bows knocked their arrows while keeping low in the settled and urged the horses to go faster what looked like a thin line in the cliff face became wider yet barely wide enough for two horses to fit through together the goblins and trolls close posed to close both set arrows and let fly aiming not for the riders but for the larger mass of the hell hounds the things road both struck true goblins and trolls tumbled as their mouths fell over those that had fallen some but not all a hail of arrows arched from the trolls whistled round them and then they were inside and racing down the narrow rock strewn defile that was the rift an echo of pain like a memory stung cloth but he had no time to dwell on it obeying rang behind them echoed from the walls hell hounds there was a tingle a riffle of magic like a breeze across his skin eyelet looked up at the french bulls stone above them and reached out to let her fingers run along the wall that slid past them as they rode hearing a rumble call off looked behind them a small rockfall now blocked their trail he looked over at islet we won't be able that echo of pain there was an arrow in her back yes we will she said tightly they'll have to clear it to chase us they must stop us by the time we return it'll be cleared eilis he said her name only islet heard the dismay and concern in his voice i know it hurts the pain was intense and each beat of smokes hooves increased it her limbs grew weak slowing the horses to a stop cloth caught her as she fell get it out cola she said tightly it would hurt and cloth knew it it was deep he hated hurting her but she was right it had to come out do it quickly he told himself although islet willed herself not to she still cried out when he pulled it there was a great deal of blood her knees went weaker why is it she said through gritted teeth at the pain and weakness that i can heal as everyone else but not myself strength seemed to drain out of her through the soles of her feet none can call off answered as he eased her down to the ground wrapped his arms around her even healers need healers,1

B00F9DXZKU,i don't remember much about the circumstances surrounding this story or for that matter exactly where my head was to be found at the time kind of a dark place i think that was in my late twenties single and not happy about it frustrated by the sluggish pace of my career and tired of working a long series of boring and unrewarding jobs to pay the rent i had no belief in god at the time but the world in general felt like it was filled with false gods gods of money power and vanity i suspect i was also responding to actual religious movements i saw around me movements that seemed to have an unhealthy us vs them mentality and that i felt wanted to drag the rest of us into their sphere of influence whether we wanted their wisdom or not it probably seemed like just the right time and place for a devastating alien invasion maybe aliens who styled themselves as gods may be aliens who saw themselves as benevolent gods even as they destroyed our world and carried us away as captives what wretched gods that was the working title of the story and of the first version that made the rounds before another rewrite and polish landed it a spot in galileo magazine galileo was a sibling or descendant of fiction magazine where my first story was published see reality and other fictions for that one among the new riders i shared the pages with were the soon to be renowned connie willis and john kessel my bio in the magazine described me as a full time writer i must have been feeling my oats on that score when i sent in my bio information or maybe it was wishful thinking i was at the time living in a very cheap apartment with three roommates so for a brief time i did technically achieve that enviable state but it didn't last long the economics of writing especially for a new writer who wrote fairly slowly dictated otherwise soon i would be writing a long novel the infinity link which took me years to complete soon i would be working again as an office tempore sorting packages for u p s there were times i think when an alien invasion would have felt like a relief i'm in a much better place now but i can still relate to the dark determination of the protagonist of this story the gods have not yet come but they will they believe i am not alone here though i don't know who is with me hanging cockeyed to my uncertain frame of reference i stare at my earth with sorrow and hate wanting to curse it to destroy it before the gods have it all my visor fogged momentarily as though to remind me of my helplessness i am weightless orbit adding falling falling motionless only the earth moves by ruined planet is a cool cheek bulging over my right shoulder a delicate cloud and water ball the stage of a hopeless trauma against the house darkness of space but it's dim nightside crescent a see one or two cities burning tiny embers slowly the planet drifts further around to the right where it will pass behind me for a little while behind the station as i float with my boots hooked on a twisted bit of station girder and stare for hour after endless hour i have the feeling that earth is nothing more than an enormous sop sweeping debris out of space and grit and mindless gambling spacemen no it is the saviors who will do that they will not miss a one down there and on their way back up they will find you hear whispers my soul find you waiting helpless,1

B0765CPCNS,the battle on atol nineteen would later be described as a minor opening skirmish in the cleansing of larin a footnote to the fighting that was yet to come but to the warriors in the spear tip of solomon demeter second company of emperor's children it felt considerably more intense then a skirmish shrieking bolts of hot green energy flashed down the curving thoroughfare melting portions of the angled walls and dissolving a starting battle plate whenever they struck one of the advancing space marines the hungry crackle of fires and the whoosh of missiles mingled with a hard bangs of bolter fire fire and the shrieking horns from the coral towers as solomon's starters fought their way up the serpentine street to link with marius verisign squads coiled towers of glittering crystal coral reared above him like the gnarled conch shells of some great sea creature with smooth rimmed barrow holes piercing the spiers like the touch holes of a musical instrument the entire atoll was formed from the same lightweight but incredibly tough material though how the structures floated above the vast oceans was a mystery the mechanical adept were eager to solve screeching cries echoed from the disturbingly alien architecture as though the spires themselves were screaming and the damnable metallic slither of the aliens movement seemed to come from mm all around them he ducked back behind a sinuous column of pink veined coral and slammed another magazine into his customized bolter it's every surface and internal working hand finished by his own artifice it's rate of fire was only marginally faster than a regular issue bolter that it had never once jammed and solomon demeter wasn't the kind of man to trust his life to anything he hadn't worked towards perfection gaius he shouted to his second-in-command gaius cavan wherein the name of the phoenician is tangier and squadron his lieutenant shook his head and solomon cursed knowing that the lair had probably int accepted the land speeder squadron en route to them damn these aliens were clever he thought remembering the grievous loss of captain essence flanking force which had revealed that the lair had somehow managed to compromise their vox net the idea of a xena species with the ability to wreak such a violation on a legion of the studies was unthinkable and had only spurred full grimms warriors to greater heights of roth in their extermination solomon demeter was the very image of an authorities his short dark hair kept shaved close to his scalp his skin tanned from the light of a score of sons and his animated features rounded and widespread on thick cheekbones he disdained the wearing of a helmet to prevent the lair from deciphering his orders over the vox network and because he knew that if he were hit in the head by one of the layer weapons he was as good as dead helmet or not knowing he could not expect any immediate help from the aerial units he knew they were going to have to do this the hard way though it railed against his sense of order and perfection to undertake this assault without the proper support in place he couldn't deny that there was something exhilarating about making things up as he went along some commanders said that it was an inevitable fact that they would often fight without the forces they wanted but such a belief was anathema to most of the emperor's children yes we're going to have to do this ourselves he shouted make sure we have plenty of fire keeping those xenos heads down keefer nodded and began issuing kurt concise orders with sharp chops of his hand to the squads spread through the rubble of what could laughingly recalled their landing zone behind them the wrecked stone warm birds still burned from where the alien missile had blown off it's wing and solomon knew that it was a miracle the pilot had managed to coax the stricken aircraft to stay in the air long enough to reach the floating at all he shuddered to imagine their fate had they plunged to the vast planetary ocean below last forever amid the sunken ruins of the lairs ancient civilization the lair had been waiting for them and now at least seven warriors were down and would never fight again solomon had no idea how the other assault units had fared but couldn't imagine they had suffered any less he risked a glance around the column it's height oddly distorted by the eye watering curves and such totally wrong dimensions everything on this at all jarred upon his sensibilities a riotous excess of color form and noise that offended the senses with their sheer frenzy he could see a wide plaza ahead in which are flaring plume of searing energy was enclosed by a ring of bright coral that shone with a dazzling light dozens of such strange plumes were spread throughout the atolls and the mechanical adepts believed that it was these peculiar devices that prevented the attack balls from falling from the sky with no major landmasses on lahren capturing the atolls intact was deemed integral to the success of the coming campaign the atolls would serve as bridge heads and staging areas for all further assaults and full grimm himself had declared that the energy plumes keeping the atol in the air were to be captured at any cost solomon caught glimpses of layer warriors slithering around the base of the energy plume their movements sinuous and inhumanly quick first captain case iran had personally tasked the second with securing the plaza and solomon had sworn an oath in the fire that he would not fail gaius take your men right and work your way through cover towards the plaza keep your head down their shoulder have warriors position to stop you send felonious on the left what about you cave and shouted back over the din of gunfire where are you going solomon smiled where else but the center i omg agitate your rosen's large but make sure gold wire are in position before i move i don't want anyone moving before we sat down our weight of fire so heavy i could walk on it sir said gavan without wishing to appear impertinent are you sure that's the right choice solomon racked the slide on his bolter and so said yo face to image over making the right choice gaius all we need do is make a good choice see it through and accept the consequences of your zirp said cavan i do shouted solomon we may not be able to do it by the book this time but by key moss will do it well now i'll pass the word solomon waited as his orders were issued to the warriors under his command and felt the familiar thrill of excitement as he prepared to take the fight to the enemy once more he knew that kaif and disapproved of his cavalier attitude but solomon firmly believe that only through such testing circa m stances could warriors better themselves and so more closely approach the perfection embodied by their primark sergeant to roseann edged up behind him his veteran warriors gathered around him in the shadow of a layer barrow complex ready sergeant r solomon indeed sap replied to erosion that let's go shouted solomon as he heard gold wire a squad open up with their support weapons the bar and thump of heavy caliber shells thundering up the road was the sound he'd been waiting for and he slid from the cover of the pillar and charged up the center of the street towards the crackling energy taller boats of deadly green energy flashed past him but he could tell they were not aimed the weight of suppressing fire keeper ing the aliens from showing themselves he heard gunfire from either side of him and knew that cavan and thelonious were having to fight their way towards the taller the veteran space marines of corrosion followed him firing from the hip and adding to the weight of fire provided by goldwater just as he thought they might re each the spire unmolested the layer attacked,1

B07DF6CPQ2,my story begins like many similar ones you may have heard of or read about or will hear about during your lifetime some will no doubt be fiction but every once in a while such a story is true i know this for a fact because it happened to me i woke in a strange hospital bed with no recollection of how i got there i also woke with a splitting headache knowing instinctively that it was not from the drink of bacchus yet later i would be told that i had certainly consumed a great amount before the accident accident i could remember nothing before awakening in the hospital bed try as i might i had no recollection of events before that time i did not know where i lived or even in what country i lived or for that matter what country i was now in worse i realized i did not even know my own name i had a terrible headache and tried to hold my hands to my temples but found i could not it was physically impossible for me to raise them or even feel them and the pain became worse and was accompanied with a fierceness that caused me to grown aloud i could feel nothing of my body either it was as though i consisted of ahead and just ahead i could see on a cream colored ceiling and side curtain through my peripheral vision so my sight was unimpaired as was my hearing for i could hear voices in the background i could not understand them however but they sounded french of which i had scant knowledge and they were doubtless conversing in that language i tried another of my faculties my voice and heard my words as though from a corridor far off at least i could speak my body was another matter and i could feel nothing when i tried to move my arms and legs neither could i turn my head at mine neck i had resigned myself to being a total paraplegic for the rest of my life when a nurse's face appeared above me it was a pleasant face and it wore a smile so i tried to smile back it must have appeared as a hideous grimace for she took it as an indication of severe pain and inquire but anxiously about my condition at least i assume that was what she said for i could understand nothing of her word she scurried away in a few minutes later a new face appeared above me it was an older face a masculine face much lined in yet with the healthy coloring of one who spent as much time as he could out of doors he to address me and french and i tried to croak something back i must have produced some words for he then spoke to me ah anglaise he spoke to someone over his shoulder and then spoke to me and further good english and how are you feeling monsieur on glaze you don't have to condescend to me i tried to growl the words but once again it came out as a croak i presume i deserve that condition i am in and am not asking for sympathy and you are assured they not getting any my route friend the face loomed closer but i could tell that it was no real animosity in the word some congratulations perhaps considering the miraculous escape you have had today i attempted a glare how can you say that i muttered i'm crippled for life ah he said again but this time i detected of all things a gleam in his eye i's so that is what you think is it that you are crippled and for life there is not a broken bone in your body monsieur merely a large amount of bruising you are what the americans call a massive contusions he pronounced the last word like a denizen of the bronx dragging it out into it least a half dozen syllables i tried to smile but could not in a short while perhaps a week the feeling will begin to return and you will wish you were back in this condition for pain will also return and in great abundance i think i must have passed out with the relief at that moment or the drugs in the inner venus assembly attached to the back of my left hand began to kick in for i knew nothing more until the next morning and the same face was before me i did not assume that he had stayed at my bedside all night but realized it was near cohen students that i chose that moment to wake up my name is decor he told me pronouncing it decor though more flowery i for my misfortune am the doctor who has been especially chosen to administer to your needs and bring comfort to your soul,0
B07G4JDPLY,introduction the year was nineteen eighty nine spiritual forces were at work calling out to those who could hear the damage to the world that humans had inflicted had just passed a critical point the earth could no longer be healed physically a spiritual calling was being shouted from deep within the earth for aid and many people heard the call at this time all over the world contemporary humans turned to traditional indigenous people for help many began seeking to live a more balanced spiritual life it was during this time that i unexpectedly received a great vision a vision that changed my life and transformed me from a self centered teenager into a healer i embarked on a mission to learn what this calling meant and what i needed to do do within months i began helping a native american medicine family in sacred ceremonies within a few years i was living with and had married into this family one of the last direct links to ancient native american medicine in that time of my youth i set up the altar for sacred lakota ceremony nice i worked with benjamin godfrey chips a spiritual interpreter of the oglala lakota sioux a practitioner of the weepy ceremony with blood links to it's originator i spent over ten years being educated in traditional medicine and healing practices through this medicine i learned the healing power of the earth i became a translator for the ceremonies which are bridges linking the ancient lakota way of life to the present moment now the calling has brought me back into mainstream america over these past few years i have come to understand better my purpose in learning these sacred ways to help remind this modern world world of the sacred knowledge and the true meaning of health and happiness my story and the information contained in this book are based on my personal experience this book describes native american concepts philosophies and actual ceremonies from a modern perspective i was an outsider raised in another culture but still welcomed with open arms into an ancient way of life during my training i was taught healing practices that can be traced back to the foundations of the earth i was expected to fully explain these concepts to non native ceremonial participants this book is a continuation of my responsibility to preserve these ancient ways for all of humankind within this text is a template for each person with the desire and heart to find his or her own vision walk with your heart and mind together as one and the path will unfold before you,0
B00IFHWQKM,i think we've found a way to make the wrapper department even more profitable than the box department pete is excited and so am i last year the rapper department caused four million dollars in losses reducing the overall profit of the company to less than one million dollars if pete is right if he found a market a breakthrough that turns the rappers into being as profitable as the rest of the business then jesus if they just break even the profit will be five million dollars i can't believe it it's too good to be true could it be that pete in his eagerness to stop the sale of his company has come up with some far fetched risky approach start at the beginning take your time i say to him and prepare yourself for in-depth scrutiny that's what i want he smiles broadly it all fell in place after don's phone call my phone call done says surprised i don't remember giving you any new ideas yeah yes you did pete insists a big one it's very nice of you to say so don is clearly confused especially in front of my boss but sorry pete what i recall is that i asked how come you can't compete against the fast printing presses on large quantities and you can on small the ones exactly pete is clearly amused by don's expression you caused us to stop feeling sorry about our apparent disadvantages and start concentrating on the advantages that we do have i see dunn says but after a moment he adds no i don't see i don't see how your ability to do quick setups can help you compete on large quantities done you missed the point i say pete didn't say he is going after the large quantities he just said that they decided to concentrate on the markets where they have an advantage congratulations pete i knew that if you overcame your obsession and that big money can only be found in the large quantities you would find that there are enough additional lucrative markets that require small quantities so tell me what are those markets i ask pleased pete doesn't answer he just clears his throat in embarrassment i burst out laughing it looks like it's not not done but me who missed the mark and by a mile okay pete tell us your brilliant idea how can quick setup help you win the large quantity market in spite of the speed of your competitors presses simple he says actually not so simple let me start by describing the cloud of our cars customers please do pete goes to the whiteboard and starts to unfold the cloud the objective of a buyer is to be in line with his corporate directives in order to be in line with his corporate directives the buyer must try to get the best financial deal from the vendors in our industry were set up as large the only way to get a price break is to order large quantities so in order to get the best financial deal from the vendor the buyer must order large quantities this is clear on the other hand pete continues in order to be in line with his corporate directives the buyer must strive to reduce inventory geez i don't have to tell you to what extent corporate culture has changed in regard to it's tolerance for holding large inventories no you don't have to tell us i full heartedly agree this means pete completes the cloud that in order to strive to reduce inventories the buyer must order in small quad entities more frequently the conflict is clear dunn says but the pressure to get low price is dominant isn't it yes pete agrees do you see any reason for that to change don continues to ask maybe pete answers as competition in the market becomes more fierce and i'm talking about the market of my clients therefore cast becomes less accurate this makes ordering large quantities more hazardous for the buyer government regulations are also a big help to us the printers every so often they refine the regulations of how the listings of the miniscule and ingredients in the food have to appear on the wrapper any change and the entire stock is obsolete but the real point is that because of the fierce competition our customers surprise their buyers with more frequent marketing campaigns which almost always involves some printing change on the wrapper their internal ca communication is so bad they don't inform the buyer about the upcoming marketing campaign done,0

B002V0RJD8,the federal army of the potomac had fought it's way south at terrible cost only to be stymied at petersburg by confederate forces fighting from behind an impregnable trench line then the ingenuity of a regiment of pennsylvania coal miners in general burnside's ninth corps created the opportunity for a breakthrough directed by their colonel a mining engineer in civilian life they dug a tunnel more than five hundred feet long right up under a confederate strong point and packed four tons of blasting powder in the galleries at it's end it was the longest military mine that had ever been dug and when the powder was touched off it would create what was the largest man-made explosion in history to spearhead the infantry attack burnside chose his fourth division nine regiments of african american soldiers the largest black military formation to that point in our history the division was given special training in the maneuvers required to exploit the breach each the mine would create the operation was designed to achieve a decisive victory more than that it was an operation that seemed to draw upon the unique strengths of the union it's mastery of industrial technology the volunteerism and skill of free labor the moral and physical energy liberated as a result of it's embrace of emancipate patient but all of this planning labor and high hope ended in embarrassing defeat it was not just the skill and courage of the confederate defenders that wrecked the union assault but the jealousy intransigence incompetence and even cowardice of federal generals hundreds of their soldiers were trapped in the huge sheer sided crater left by the mine explosion helpless to defend themselves the closing phase of the battle was marked by a combination massacre and race riot as white troops both union and confederate turned against the black soldiers to make matters worse this debacle or came just as lincoln's reelection campaign was beginning it intensified the growing crisis of public confidence in lincoln's war policy and strengthen the prospects of the peace democrats who opposed both the war effort and the emancipation of the slaves the failure was investigated by a military court of inquiry in august eighteen sixty four and later by congress's joint committee on the conduct of the war the jcc w historians have generally accepted the finding of the court that burnside and his division commanders were responsible for the fiasco but the court was primarily interested in limiting the embarrassment suffered by the army and it's senior commanders instead of using the investigation to expose and correct the systemic flaws that crippled the army of the potomac the court ignored and thereby perpetuated them the court also ignored the unique feature years of the battle the racially motivated killing of wounded men the murder of p o w's and the white on black violence within the federal ranks the battle of the crater is worth a closer look it's role in the campaign against richmond was more significant than contemporaries realized or most historians have allowed the assault of july thirtieth was part of a larger and largely successful maneuver plan developed by general grant which modeled the tactics by which he would eventually break lee's defenses few historians have taken a critical look at lee's handling of the battle yet there is good reason to think that grant out general de lie in the lead up to the crater and that lee was lucky to have avoided disaster but the real interest of the battle of the crater lies in what it reveals about an american society at war with itself the battle was fought at a moment of equilibrium in the struggle between two systems of thought and social organization slavery on one side free labor on the other however within each of the rival systems transforming forces were at work the south was faced with a radical choice between the preservation of slavery and national survival lincoln's reelection campaign presented supporters of the union with stark choices about how the war should be fought and what kind society ought to come out of it presidential politics would powerfully influence the decisions that produced the battle above all the battle of the crater is worth a closer look because the flash of it's explosion illuminates the centrality of race in the tangle of social and political conflicts that shaped american life as the civil war approached it's climax because of the racial element participants would remember this the most intense and vicious combat of the war and even the passage of time did not allay the bitterness it engendered the animosities exposed on this battlefield were the same passions that would wreck postwar attempts to reconstruct the nation as a multiracial democracy my purpose in writing this book is to give the reader a clear and accurate account of the strategic setting and the battle action as it developed hour by hour and to show how the culture and politics of that place and time shape the way the soldiers fought in the meanings they saw in their experience of war,0
B00EFE296U,flat no angels singing he'd simply realized he was damn good and fed up with the status quo glamorous though it was acting in movies was alright mostly easy work if deadly boring a lot of the time but lately it had been getting harder and harder to tell the diff since between playing a part and the real deal the offshoot of all this sudden clarity was that zane had found himself on a car lot in l a trading in his supercharged european ride for a shiny silver pickup truck with an extended cab in a spate of nonverbal ad libbing he'd driven the new truck to the nearest animal shelter gone inside and adopted a dog an unprepossessing critter big and black with floppy ears he dubbed the animal slim mainly because it's ribs showed a key consequence of missing a few meals along the way leaving pretty much everything else he owned behind zine with slim had headed north by northeast stopping only to grab a couple of drive thru burgers here and there gas up the truck and snooze a little in restaurant parking lots they had reached hangman's band late the previous night camping out in the unfurnished ranch house that morning slam had taken a liking to a certain shady spot on the porch so he'd stayed behind when zayn set out to get a good look at the wooded section of his land he was on foot because his horse blackjack jack was still in transit from the california stables where he'd been boarding the gelding since his move to l a several years earlier he followed the meandering creek for a bit enjoying the way it stitched it's path through the woods like a wide strand of silver thread clear and sun sparkled and almost musical as it rolled over worn stones that resembled jewels under the water caused around primordial boulders and tree stumps some of them petrified on it's way to wherever it was going zayn made a mental note to check a map later when he got back to the house because he liked knowing the facts about things like knowing exactly where he was both literally and figuratively but at the moment he was in no great hurry to turn homeward he was out to find the southern corner of his property soon supposedly staked out and flagged at least eight feet wide probably ten or twelve in some places the stream would be difficult to cross but eventually he came to a natural bridge a line of six flagstones small and fairly far apart still fit even after living fancy from the day he'd sign that first film contract till he left hollywood behind him he figured he could make it to the other side without getting his boots wet let alone taking a header into that glacier chilled creek water with his arms outstretched for balance the way he and landry used to do when they want the top rail of a fence as kids he moved with relative ease never setting both feet down on the same rock since there wasn't room when he reached the opposite bank no longer concentrating so hard he stopped short startled by what amounted to a vision a wood nymph dressed in faded blue jeans battered boots and a pale green western shirt stood in the center of the small clearing just ahead both arms wrapped around the trunk of a lone cottonwood tree her hair was brown and shiny and thick just brushing her shoulders and it caught the leaf filtered light through it around like colored beams and a prism her head was tilted back slightly her eyes closed and the expression on her fine boned face was downright blissful what the hell hussein could have watched her for hours just looking at the woman gave him the same belly clenching thrill he'd gotten in his bronc riding days in that moment before the shoot gates swung open and the official eight second count down began but suddenly off his game he took an unintended half step in her direction a twig snapped under the sole of his boot and the moment was over the nymphs eyes were wide hazel her may be green or pale grey and at the moment seeing him they were shooting fire she backed away from the tree and they noticed that her shirt was open and she was wearing a tank top under,0

B00LV5AC3S,the intrusion of the first raman spacecraft into the inner solar system in early twenty one thirty had a powerful impact on human history although there were no immediate changes in everyday life after the crew headed by commander norton returned from encountering rama one the clear and unambiguous proof that a vastly superior and diligence existed or as a minimum had existed somewhere else in the universe forced a rethinking of the place of homo sapiens in the overall scheme of the cosmos it was now apparent that other chemicals doubtless also fabricated in the great stellar cataclysms of the heavens had risen to consciousness in some other place at some other the time who were these romans why had they built a giant sophisticated spacecraft and send it on an excursion into our neighborhood both in public and private conversation the romans were the number one topic of interest for many months for well over a year mankind waited more or less patiently for another sign of the robin's presence in the universe intense telescopic investigations were conducted at all wavelengths to see if any additional information associated with the retreating alien space scrubbed could be identified nothing was found the heavens were quiet the romans were departing a swiftly and inexplicably as they had arrived once excalibur was operational and initial search of the heavens turned up nothing new there was a noticeable change in the collective human attitude toward that first contact with rama overnight the encounter became a historical event something that had happened and was now completed the tenor of newspaper and magazine articles that had earlier begun with phrases like when the romans return changed to if there is ever another encounter with the creatures who built the huge spaceship discovered in twenty one thirty what had been a perceived threat a lien in a sense on future human behavior was quickly reduced to historical curiosity there was no longer an urgency to deal with such fundamental issues as the return of the robins or the destiny of the human race in a universe peopled by intelligent creatures mankind relaxed at least for a moment then it exploded in a paroxysm of narcissistic behavior that made all previous historical periods of individual selfishness pale by comparison the surge of unabashed self indulgence on a global scale was easy to understand something fundamental in the human side he had changed as a result of the encounter with rama one prior to that contact humanity stood alone as the only known example of advanced intelligence in the universe the idea that humans could as a group control their destiny far into the future had been a significant linchpin in almost every working philosophy of life that the romans existed or had existed whatever the tents the philosophic logic came to the same conclusion changed everything the mankind was not unique maybe not even special it was just a question of time before the prevailing hama centric notion of the universe was to become irrevocably shattered by clearer awareness of the others thus it was easy to comprehend why the life patterns of most human beings suddenly veered toward self gratification reminding literary scholars of a similar time almost exactly five centuries earlier when robert herrick had exhorted the virgins to make the most of their fleeting time in a poem that began gather ye rosebuds while ye may old time is still a flying an unrestrained burst of conspicuous consumption and global greed lasted for just under two years frantic acquisition of everything the human mind could create while superimposed on a weak economic infrastructure that had been already poised for a downturn in early twenty one thirty when the first ramen spaceship flew through the inner solar system the looming recession was first postponed throughout twenty one thirty and twenty one thirty one by the combined manipulative efforts of governments and financial institutions even though the fundamental economic weaknesses were never addressed with the renewed burst of buying in early twenty one thirty two the world jumped directly into another period rapid growth production capacities were expanded stock markets exploded and both consumer confidence and total employment hit all time highs there was unprecedented prosperity and the net result was a short term but significant improvement in the standard of living for almost all humans by the end of the year in twenty one third the three it had become obvious to some of the more experienced observers of human history that the ramen boom was leading mankind towards disaster dire warnings of impending economic doom started being heard above the euphoric shouts of the millions who had recently,1
B002V014FM,rocco's hard-drinking haman had graduated from the law department of the university of kansas then set off for indian territory present-day oklahoma where he clerked in the store in newkirk when the kiowa comanche country opened up to settlement jake went in with the first rush of new settlers to ladin then an indian town over the next few years he had been named laden's first city attorney and chairman of the oklahoma republican territorial committee made money building a railroad with john ringling the circus impresario and then got into oil where the real money was with a nineteen twenty presidential election coming up jake decided to gamble almost everything he had on backing a long shot in the nineteen twenty repub silicon presidential convention senator warren g harding from ohio haman borrowed nearly one million dollars from the national city bank of new york today's citibank using his substantial oil holdings as collateral he took his bankroll to chicago and spread his money around where it counted buying delegates and influencing the people who needed in influencing working in tandem with harding's campaign manager harry my cage o'doherty heyman got warren harding the republican presidential nomination six months later warren harding was elected president of the united states going into the convention harding had been a forty to one shot haman agreed to back him on the condition that if he he was nominated and made it to the white house harding would appoint haman secretary of the interior that would give heyman control of the teapot dome naval reserve in wyoming and oil supply potentially worth several hundred million dollars nineteen twenty dollars a bonanza so rich that it was almost beyond comprehension of course jake wasn't going to pocket at all he agreed to lease out the government fields to some of his friends in the oil business who in turn would kick back a third of the take to jay heyman had a fortune within his grasp that could put him in the same league as old john d rockefeller the richest man in america and jake already knew what he was going to do with a big chunk of the money make his son president of the united states if heyman and big oil could get an empty suit like harding elected putting a bright ambitious kid like jake junior in the white house would be a breeze when the time came of course there was a caveat regarding the interior post initially jake hadn't thought the matter would prove a problem but he'd been badly mistaken and when haman and harding first met in new york before the convention they discovered to their mutual amazement that their wives were related second cousins in fact this of course had given jake a big in with harding but it also presented a problem once the duchess as harding called his wife florence got the low down on jake and clara she insisted that jay get back with his wife before coming to washington florence harding wasn't going to allow her cousin's husband to come to washington accompanied by some twenty seven year old floozy clara had to go harding spelled out the demands in a letter jake had brought back from the chicago convention packed in his trunk it stated unequivocally that haman had to resume his legal marital relations before he could be considered for an appointment not that harding cared one way or another he chased anything in a skirt that was no secret but florence was a tough old bird there was no getting around her of course jake waited until after harding won the election to break the bad news to clara no point in getting her all riled up until he was sure harding had the job clara wasn't the kind of woman you wanted to give up unless you had a good reason and jake had to have the best money and power jake would be gentle as in settling with her of course he'd already given clara couple of oil wells from which she received small royalties he'd instructed his business manager frank catch to work out a reasonable agreement clara would walk away from their ten year relationship a well to do woman with enough to put her younger brother jimmy through college and take care of her ailing father j t smith down in el paso back a decade or so ago jt had come after jake with a pistol for having absconded with poor innocent clara fortunately the sheriff managed to disarm him before he could do any damage all jt had a nasty temper but then so did clara though she had seemed calm enough when jake told her that he had to leave her that he he was going back to his wife icy calm in fact he broke the news on november seventh and gave clara three weeks to clear out explaining that his wife and family would be arriving at the end of the month in ardmore god knows jake told clara he hadn't wanted it to end this way not after ten years didn't know what he'd do without her jag wanted know paying more than to bring clara with him to washington take her to black tie dinners at the white house and formal balls have her meet heads of state even royalty but the president elect of the united states had insisted either get back with his wife or forget about the interior job what choice did he have the day after jake broke the news clara went out and bought a twenty five caliber pistol that jake hadn't known,0

B086H2C5BJ,only a few weeks after his illuminating and remarkable trip to the alien world of new care glenn dan mccarthy found himself dealing with a revelation as remarkable as any before it leisha his closest friend among the extraterrestrial messengers whose proven existence had changed life on earth forever or a serious but not severe expression as he delivered the news the aliens limited facial features certainly impaired his ability to express himself physically the lack of eyebrows was something dan could never have imagined would make such a difference but the words he spoke carried more than enough weight on their own the fact that dan could still understand leisha without a physical cable based connection was in itself something he would likely have to explain to the public at large fairly soon but the content of what leisha had just telepathically communicated was where the real difficulties lay part of dan saw the news as an opportunity but that part was small are you sure this gateway you found definitely leads to the architect's world tara ford asked leisha from her position at dan's side the only other human presence and one of precious few he was happy to share everything with after a sudden flash that had initially taken both humans by surprise bringing with it the arrival of leisha which was a less surprising follow up but still an incredible thing to behold the alien had delivered this urgent news to the two people who simply had to hear it like dan he trusted tara absolutely responding to terror leisha nodded in the slow and somewhat cumbersome manner he had adopted in imitation of his human friends it lies in the sky directly above the architect's outpost he insisted the memory of new character lens second shelter and it's disturbing contents had never left dan's mind in the past few weeks and tara had heard enough of the harrowing details to feel just as uncomfortable about leashes revelations as dan was leashes race the peaceful messengers had been needlessly confined to a so called shelter for thousands of years by a race of technologically superior architects who had convinced them that their home planet of new carolyn was becoming uninhabitable from afar the architects used radio light communication devices to deliver instructions to the messengers for so long that leashes kind came to see the machines as godlike elders whose word was unquestioned most disturbingly of all the contents of the second shelter that dan had recently explored with leisha revealed that the architect's deceit had been kinda acted with a very specific and ominous purpose that of using the messengers as an arm's length buffer against the potentially dangerous technological development of a third race with whom the architects wished to have no direct dealings humanity the only good things to have been discovered in the shelter were two kinds of small and great patch like devices both of which were worn on the back of the neck and both of which temporarily granted limited uplift powers the square patches which dan and tara were currently wearing enabled effortless telepathic communications between intelligent humanoid species as well as individuals of the same kind the other variety physically identical but for their triangular shape allowed the wearer to interpret the otherwise invisible information rich transcripts which had been created by the architects as a way of quickly conveying complex data the past few weeks had seen dan's inner circle engage in the early study of these patches with his grave friend timo fiore an alien obsessed billionaire who had sufficient resources and sufficient trust in dan's mind to perform these tests securely from his company's headquarters in colorado springs until just a few minutes ago these ongoing tests had been one of the main things in dan's mind now however i like so much else the remarkable patches weren't even an afterthought the general public had no idea yet about the architects much less the nature of their deceit with the only news to have leaked out being that a second shelter had been discovered on new curriculum this structure known to dan and the messengers as the outpost given that this was how the architect's transcripts had described it was first spotted by a human crew sent to assist in the repair of the great shelter to which leashes entire race had been cruelly and unnecessarily confined for so long the initial revelation that the world outside the shelter was safe had raised eyebrows on earth but damn i knew that the additional details regarding the outpost and it's creators would be on a whole different level of explosiveness when they became known,1
0008267545,i have appreciated it before he launches into the a team the song he wrote ten years ago that changed everything for him if you know the words then sing along he says it seems as if sixty thousand people do there's no such thing as can't sing he tells us only can't sing in tune that is certainly the case of practically every one near me but nobody cares cleverly he merges don't from his second album multiply with new man from divide both harsh and slightly bitter breakup songs between numbers ed may not have the distinctive patter of adele but he chats in a relaxed fashion that appears perfectly natural and friendly not at all scripted apparently he last played cardiff in twenty eleven and vowed then that he wouldn't come back until he could fill this great stadium that ambition didn't take long to achieve he asks for our biggest screen before changing pace to dive perhaps the most underrated song on divide it's a romantic ballad but not a soppy one don't call me baby unless you mean it is a chorus to sing at the top of your voice in the shower as each song passes i'm more and more struck by how everyone knows the woods i suppose it's an indication of the sheer scale of his popularity edge strategy is that it's a participation show and he wants everyone to sing and dance although he reminds us that he can't dance even if the famous video to thinking out loud gives the impression that he's a natural ed wants us all to dance whether we can or not amusingly he points out that there is always two per cent of an audience that refuses to sing or dance that either the grumpy reluctant boyfriend or the super dad who's being a hero acting as chaperone for their son or daughter ed's own dad john sheeran was exactly that taking his boy along to countless gigs that gave him a vitally important musical education when he was young enough to absorb many influences and moves easily between different styles often in the same song they might build from a wrap or a quiet verse into one of those anthemic choruses you can't get out of your head he sings three songs in a row that reflect the agony of love bloodstream from the multiply album starts quietly biff you're transforming into one of his most dramatic crescendos and a powerful wall of sound happier is for me his most melancholy song a story of love lost a recurring theme with ed the poignant lyric touches anyone who's ever taken a wrong turn in love and that would be everyone i'm a mess is another song that reflects a zone intelligence and openness in his lyrics i wish i had a fiver for every time someone's told me that they like the autobiographical touches he includes in his songs it's time to lighten the mood a little and go away go does exactly that some critics don't like this song and i've heard it described as marmite you either love it or you hate it but we're all up having a hooley in the aisles ed has always embraced his irish heritage and my guess is that this will become a party classic in the years ahead ed doesn't do many covers so it's a surprise when he slips feeling good into the setlist although many people know it as a michael buble song from a decade ago it's actually a much older stage musical number that became an instant classic when it was recorded by the matchless nina simone in nineteen sixty five the late george michael also featured it on his last studio album symphonic her in twenty fourteen i wonder if there are any similarities between ed and george arguably the two greatest solo male pop stars the uk has produced ad cleverly mashes his version into the haunting i see fire the song he wrote for the twenty thirteen film the hobbit the desolation of smaug ed changes guitars were practically every number he is handed an electric guitar for the first time and mentions amy watch one of his original collaborators who still lives locally in south wales and is in the audience tonight if you don't know the words to this one then you're probably at the wrong show he announces then plays the opening chords of the sublime thinking out loud which he wrote with amy everyone goes into a huge romantic sigh instead of the thousand stars in the lyric,0

B011DDWVGS,long at the ranch not since that summer when she had been seventeen it's about time you thought about coming home for good he said there's no reason for me to his dark eyes glinted at her from under the brim of his hat but he didn't say anything and when he turned and began threading his way through the groups of people catherine followed him without saying anything either sometime she thought the communication between her and rule was impossible but at other times it seemed that no words were necessary she didn't understand him but she knew him knew his pride his toughness his damned black temper that was no less frightening for being controlled she had grown up knowing that rule jackson was a dangerous man her formative years had been dominated by him he let her out of the air terminal and across the pavement to the area where private aircraft were kept his long legs eating up the distance without effort but catherine wasn't used to keeping up with his stride and she refused to trot after him like a dog on a leash she maintained her own pace keeping him inside and at last he stopped beside a blue and white twin engine cessna opening the cargo door and storing her bags inside then looking around impatiently for her hurry it up he call old seeing that she was still some distance away catherine ignored him he put his hands on his hips and waited for her his booted feet braced in an arrogant stance that came naturally to him when she reached him he didn't say a word he merely pulled the door open and turned back to her catching her around the waist and lifting her easily into the plane she moved to the copilot seat and rule swung himself into the pilot seat then closed the door and tossed his hat onto the seat behind him raking his lean fingers through his hair before reaching for the headset catherine watched him her expression revealing nothing but she couldn't help remembering the vitality of that thick dark hair the way it had curled around her fingers he glanced at her and caught her watching him she didn't look guiltily away but held her gaze knowing that the still blankness of her face gave away nothing do you like what you see he taunted softly letting the headset dangle from his fingers why did monica send you she asked flatly ignoring his question and attacking with one of her own monica didn't send me you forgotten i run the ranch not monica his dark eyes rested on her waiting for her to flare up at him and shout that she owned the ranch not he the catherine had learned well how to hide her thoughts she kept her face blank her gaze unwavering exactly i'd have thought you were too busy to waste time fetching me i wanted to talk to you before you got to the ranch this seemed like a perfect opportunity so talk let's get airborne first flying in a small plane was no novelty to her from her birth she had been accustomed to flying since a plane was considered essential to a rancher she sat back in the seat and stretched her cramped muscles sore from the long flight from chicago big jet screamed as they came in for landings or lifted off but rule was unruffled as he talked to the tower and taxi to a clear strip and only minutes they were up and skimming westward houston shimmering in the spring heat too the south of them the earth beneath had the rich green hue of new grass and catherine drink in the sight of it whenever she came for a visit she had to force herself to leave and had always left an ache for months as if something vital had been torn from her she loved this land loved the ranch but she had survived these years only by keeping to her self imposed exile talk she said shortly trying to stem the memories i want you to stay this time he said and catherine felt as if he had punched her in the stomach stay didn't he of all people know how impossible that was for her she slid a quick sideways glance at him and found him frowning intently at the horizon for a moment her eyes lingered on the strong profile before she jerked her head forward again no comment he asked it's impossible is that it you're not even going to ask why while i like the answer no he shrugged what is not something you can avoid,0

B06XRP1VCZ,police are swallowed by the blustery wind howling through the fields my feet stick as if i'm wading through waist deep mud i cannot make their move the world seems off somehow my feeder stone they keep me prisoner the soldiers the man they don't seem affected by it at all they move freely again i call out begging please take me instead it is me that you want they ignore me acting as if i'm not even there i try to scream again but i cannot desperation squeezes my throat choking off the very air i breathe molten lead flows through my veins burning cooling and solidifying all at the same time my muscles stiffen like stone i cannot move i cannot speak i cannot scream josephine josephine careful to avoid the hands of her lover striking out against something she could not even begin to wrap her mind around gently tucked herself behind the unsettled man in the bed beside her she whispered calming words calmed her fingers through his hair and held him in her arms until he stopped beating the air in front of him struggling against the blankets tangled around his limbs she kept a tight grip on him telling him he was okay that all was right that he was home josephine was one of the few people including his parents and the soldiers who had fought beside him that knew of his nightly battles and she was the only one who had ever been able to calm him down during one of them thomas let out a groan that echoed across the low ceiling of their cubicles shielding his eyes with his arm ripples of taut muscle tensed and then relaxed again concealing the steel beneath the soft skin that had been scraped clean the previous day at the baths josephine sat up beside him clutching the linens close to her chest she drank him in as she did every morning through the villas windows the earliest rays of the sun filtered into the room slowly caressing his bronze skin like the hands of a lover for a moment she became jealous of the pale yellow light grinning as she thought of the previous night she bit her thumb and watched him fight to stay asleep he shifted positions from his left side to his right fluffed his pillow and squeezed his eyes closed when that failed he covered his face with it it was all she could do to rein in her mirth knowing her giggles would make him aware he was being watched in the end thomas gave in he always did there was much work to be done and idleness though tolerated within their higher class was not something josephine was accustomed to partaking in even as a small child she recalled her father's words anyone with a mind could find something with which to busy themselves idleness only lead to trouble when the skin of her bare feet met the tesserae she shivered that day was to be hot but the air of the morning still provided a cooling breeze august had been nearly unbearable and the great fire had made it doubly so she washed her face and told off quickly arranged her dark blue stoller and affix the golden brooch that ensured the garment stayed in place more rustling sounds came from the bed while josephine sat at her small wooden table and comb through her long silky strands of dark brown hair is one particular not gave into her ministrations thomas has grown acquiescing to the time of day through the mirror she watched him rise and dress proud of him for accomplishing so much at such a young age he had been a warrior for rome fighting bravely to extend the boundaries of the empire and soon he would be a senator of course that fact would have to be kept secret for awhile instead of the customary purple stripe adorning his toga he wore one that was devoid of color she imagined him wearing the true colors of the title he would soon hold sen josephine was proud of his accomplishments,1
B002V085TU,tell me where to find liquid but can't always tell you whether it's oil or water until somebody invents a pair of eyes that can see under the ground drilling for oil will always be a las vegas sized gamble but that's another thing i like about this business it's sink or swim make it big or not at all you have to have the stomach for it or you won't survive for some reason that works for me i stood on a raised metal grading coiling up the heavy chains they used to set drill pipe even with noise protectors on my ears the decibel level of the diesel engines was shouting loud it didn't seem to bother the roughnecks though they communicated with hand signals when they had to some of the signals were easy to figure like a cirque goal to rev it up and some weren't but the roughnecks knew them all but had to their lives depended on it i looked up and saw a helicopter settling onto a landing pad above my head it's high pitched engines screaming like trumpets introducing the boss himself the chopper skids hadn't hardly touched down when out stepped jack patterson better known as spin the thirty eight year old ceo of gulf texas oil with him was joe wright his chief engineer and bud high tower the sixty five year old founder of gulf techs who was chairman the company and its biggest shareholder he also happen to be spins father-in-law considering spin and married audrey hi tower when they graduated from college mr hightower was lean and tall with a grey buzz cut and weathered skin and a cigarette that never fell out of his mouth that he'd had a cowboy hat on he would have been the marlboro man joe wright the chief engineer or glasses and a baggy jumpsuit a bit of a geek but smart as a fox spin was another story he was rich powerful and good looking the kind of big dog all the other dogs wanted to run with he had on this dark suit and a silver hardhat with the gulf text logo on it but underneath the glitz he was a regular guy who was comfortable shooting the breeze with the roughnecks and getting a feel for what was really going on according to dad spins biggest problem is trimming the company's fat by getting rid of old rigs obsolete machinery and things they don't need even though spin was young and married to the boss's daughter everybody respected him because he'd come up the hard way first he was a roughneck then a wildcatter then he was head of a drilling service company and corpus dad said he'd taken over gulf tags when it was about to go bankrupt and in only three years turned it around wilson said he was a man with vision who understood that the only way to find oil was with modern technology apparently that's why he'd hire joe wright this genius engineer from the university of texas spin led the way down the metal steps to the landing where i was standing when his helicopter shut down the engines i lifted off my ear protectors and waited for him to come by the minute he saw me he smiled and stuck out his hand near max what brings you out here he shouted it's june mr paterson schools out by yelled it's my chance to be a roughneck he pulled the strap under my hard hat and hit the top keep that thing on tight okay he started to leave then stopped and looked at me you know what he said after thinking it over why don't you climb up to the crane cab and watch from up there you'll get a view of everything and park and explain what's going on he lifted his walkie-talkie hit the transmit button and told the crane operator puck tarver i was coming up i don't think puck liked the idea at first because spin turned away to talk to him in private but after that he smiled at me and pointed at the steel ladder leading six stories up to the control cab i waved at him grabbed my ear protectors and went for the latter while spin and mister hightower walked down the metal steps to the main deck by the time i'd reached the cab it felt like i'd climbed up a circus ladder to a high wire platform i opened the door entered and sat in the chair behind paul ok who got his nickname because he played semi pro hockey he was wearing a hardhat earphones with a microphone curled in front of his mouth and dark sunglasses and he was busy raising a heavy new caterpillar diesel engine from a seagoing barge up to the main deck of the platform i watched him operate the crane controls the joysticks foot pedals and buttons while he talked to the guys on the deck below i was curious about which levers took the crane hook in which direction but i didn't interrupt to ask there was an extra headset on the control panel so i picked it up and put it over my head and listened as park and a roughneck guiding the payload into position talk to each other yeah i recognize the other voice instantly it was my brother wills i looked down and saw him standing next to an empty mud pit a shallow well on the deck where they were going to store the engine waiting for the crane to bring the engine to him looking at the other side of the deck i saw spin joe and mr high tower great my dad with handshakes and shouts over the noise then i saw spin and mr hightower walked to the railing on the far side of the platform and looked down at a fuel boat delivery hose that was being lifted by a small crane when it got up to the deck a couple of rough next with goggles and gloves grabbed it and guided it's nozzle into a metal coupling and a few minutes later the hosts swelled up with diesel fuel that was being pumped into a huge tank on the deck diesel oils critical on a drilling platform because it runs all the engines generators and pumps you need to produce a field it seemed kind of ironic to me all that oil being burned defined more oil back on the near side of the platform the caterpillar engine dangled a few feet above the deck puck talked into his mic didn't get an answer from will asked will if he could hear him then repeated himself but still got no answer he tapped the mic with his finger cost when it didn't work and pulled a plastic pill case out of his breath pocket he opened it and fished out a couple of white pills and said excedrin to me holding three in his hand when i shook my head no he put the case back into his pocket and held onto the pills i could hear him talking into the mic but i heard no answer in my headset from will or anyone else on the deck evidently the intercom was busted how they could put a man on the moon but couldn't get an intercom to work was a mystery to me but it happened all the time i saw puck change channels from number two to number three on his headset and say my receptions out spin can't hear wheel on channel two and i can't hear you on channel three can you hear me if you can give me a hand signal i saw spin wave to park saying yes he could hear put cupped his hand around his mic and talked into it so he didn't have to yell at spin over the cab noise i couldn't hear what he said but apparently he and spin got their hand signals worked out pok pok the three excedrin pills into his mouth to them up without water and worked the joist it a second later the caterpillar engine began then moving across the deck toward the mud pit that's when it happened puck looked over at me with his mouth open in surprise what's wrong i said his face turned red like he was doing sit ups his hands rose to his throat and he pitched forward against the glass window knocking his hardhat to the floor park i got out of my chair and leaned over him his cheek was pushed up against the glass his eyes were half open and his skin was sweaty i looked down and saw the diesel engine swinging across the deck a few feet above the surface i hit the transmit button on my mic pox passed out i yelled channel two will no answer channel three can anybody hear me down there pucks passed out i tried talking on all channels but nobody answered as i found out later they could hear me but i couldn't hear them wheel and the roughnecks looked up at me i pointed at poc collapsed against the window yelled into my mic again pox out and threw my hands high into the air what should i do the two ton diesel engine was approaching the mud pit but when the roughnecks raised their hands to stop it it's weight was too much and it sailed by they looked up at me what's happening up there i looked at the control panel the joystick had arrows pointing in four directions north east south and west but i couldn't tell what they meant when it came to understanding the direction of the swinging payload i started talking to myself if i push it forward which way will it go i could see an arrow pointing forward but i didn't know if that meant up or down same for right and left fuckin dyslexia when i played quarterback my center had to touch his right or left knee just to make sure i knew which way the play was going i wiped away the sweat dripping off the end of my nose and looked down at the deck everything was happening fast the diesel engine was headed for the edge of the platform will was drawing his hand across his neck telling me to copy engine i looked for the ignition switch but couldn't find it the payload kept moving it was headed right at mister high tower who is leaning over the railing looking down at the fuel boat i saw men cup their hands at their mouths and yell at him i grabbed the joystick and pushed it to the side hoping for the best,0

B01GONKEXY,a brunette a raven haired beauty and a girl looking like a peacock i'll walk into a bar no it's not a joke it's my not so mundane life that generally feels like the setup for a wisecrack no matter how many times my friends and i claim we are going to do something new every friday night we find our tushes planted mulligans however today our weekly friday night venture truly seemed out of the cards says my friends were originally too tired from their workweeks to consider anything short of collapsing when you are in your early thirties and single you should be embracing life not rotting on a sofa thus when my friends veiled i detoured into warped records which is both a second home and how i envisioned my little corner of heaven some would call the smell of old album covers a dank stench but to me it's a must a perfume that seeps into my pores and comforts me with the knowledge that no matter what fails me i always have my sanctuary among the bins of paradise and the blaring suzy the perfect gem captured my gaze and held it for ransom before me was a pair of eyes so unlike any other that they were nearly indescribable piercing know that implies they shot through my skin and reached my heart however these somehow reached my soul captivating again that was misleading while they did hold my attention they also kept me at bay perhaps haunting yes they did indeed haunt me they also seemed to follow me to wherever i stood a truer description was so elusive that the color wasn't easily defined they were deep blue yet also flannel grey with a hint of green in a certain light they seemed black with specks of gold all of these emotions and colors were brought forth by just one picture a picture on an album that had been slipped into plastic and unceremoniously tacked to the wall yet somehow it jumped out at me and begged for worship who are those guys i asked shane the store's clerk james tight black pants white split ends t-shirt black suspenders and short curly brown hair made him look like a skinny nineteen eighties teenager in a forty something year old's body his hot pink english beat button sold the outfit in an odd way our obsessions make us kindred spirits it may be like we are third cousins twice removed but kindred nonetheless not a glue shane absent mindedly tapped a pencil on a notepad while his hazel eyes sat on a ragged copy of rolling stone that was decades out of date how is it you don't know you're the super genius no one can stump his side conceding to the call of duty i suppose you want me to halt my important work work and show it to you if it's not too much of a bother to pull yourself away from that fascinating article on access that is so old it will soon disintegrate then yes please i would appreciate your struggle of removing the tack for a lady with a flick of his wrist shane sent the magazine spinning across the counter jeez you practically live here so i thought you would be more at home yanking the thing of yourself glad to see that chivalry is alive and well at warped records the album was presented with a bow my lady as per your request shane smugness made me grin anyway and that arrived with some other records from a reasoned estate sale rob seemed to know who they were my eyes honed in on the price tag six dollars that's a lot for a potentially crappy band no one has heard of shane's view floated from the magazine to the notepad me up six bucks is what this says i hung it next to the two hundred dollar jagger signed goats head soup to be funny for men who were partially obscured by a golden overlay of paisleys and swirls stared back at me their clothes were colorful slightly edwardian and accented with for it was all very fashionable for the nineteen sixty eight copyright printed on the back of the cover that held no liner notes three of the men felt so insignificant that they were but mere blurs all i notice was the cute one with a sandy blond hair and magnetic eyes whose signature started with a lie better p my fingers glided over the autograph the anc felt as if it were luxurious azure velvet it also gave off an energy that put a beat in my head what really caught my attention was a spot of what appeared to be dried blood when i touched it a fuzz reminiscent of the thrill i get when hearing a vintage guitar effects pedal vibe rated through i had to have that album my purchase consisted of a modest haul of a single three cds and the mysterious album i could not let out of my clutches,0
B00CA68K0O,seen from high up in the pure sharp nighttime sky the cool lake surface sparkled with the light of stars a flawless glittering carpet spread out to the horizons and beyond the black arch of the sky blended perfectly with the waters of the economy are far below the whole world seemed to be suspended in a spell of silence as the countless movements of heaven earth and sea all blended into a timeless frozen hush suspended in a crystal ball a flyer could ride the cold night winds and dream unruffled dreams hanging high above the waves a single lonely figure rode the winds with stubby wings brilliant in plumes of orange red and gold the great bird where downward through a cool mountain breeze a fantastic addled creature fashioned from ten parts tail and two parts beak to one part brain the great bird strike seemed like a fistful of silken ribbons through the sky drawn by a point of light which glittered oh so brightly just above the open sea he swirled across the inky sky saw what lay ahead and suddenly felt his spirit soar cradled in it's tiny harbour the city state of some brea shown against the darkness like a cup of fallen stars the clean white walls shot upward from the shoreline like rearing foam while the towers and streets seemed strong with iridescent pearls the great giddy bird stared down at the sight in awe aw his beak hanging open as the lights dazzled his eyes he hovered clumsily tail dangling and great yellow feet pumping at the empty air flicking his head this way and that as he tried to make sense out of an astonishing new world suddenly the bird folded up his wings and dove he shot low across the rooftops across the battlements and walls past ranks of guards and barbet helmets of white steel and crossbow men dressed in brig and teens past the catapults mounted on the battlements and the silken banners streaming in the breeze the bird rolled happily in the swirling currents of city air his long tail swishing like noisy streamers in his wake he turned a giddy loop the loop and let out a raucous peel of joy all across the city dogs began to howl fresh milk curdled the chickens mislaid and something rather unpleasant happened to all the cheese and still the firebird sang he carried out a love that wrapped itself about im like a phoenix flame he sang with a delight as pure and fresh as morning dew he clucked he shrieked and yodel that frequencies far above mere mortal hearing bands crumbling mortar on high rooftops and sending gargoyles sliding off on sudden one way journeys to the streets below great expressive eyes suddenly fell upon a blaze of color far below with a cry of joy the bird dove off between two marble towers frightened a nest of sturges half to death and swooped to a halt outside a magnificent banquet hall,1
B00AVZ94D8,the sun had set only moments before but the door to the village hospice was already closed fast and locked for the night i gave it hardly a thought and putting boot to wood kicked it open with a stunning crash one or two people of the dozen there yelped with terror as they all came to their feet turning to face me as i strode in a few unconsciously made holy signs against me that true faith is now a rare thing about over here so i felt little or nothing of it where is she i demanded they were already white faced from my sudden appearance for no one ventures out after dark here and anyone who does is exactly the sort one would not wish to encounter it was obvious no one wished to encounter me as my gaze swept over them if if you'll please your lordship began one of the men shaking from head to toe as he came hesitantly forward hands out in a placating manner this did not bode well i do not please where is she his eyes rolled up in his head and he fainted right at my feet with some disgust for cowards have ever revolted me i fixed my gaze on an older woman behind him where tears rolled down her cheeks she left off wringing our hands and pointed a trembling at a curtained alcove at the far end of the long low building that served as a communal shelter for the homeless in the village tears gods and shadows together please not again five long steps and i was there throwing the curtain back staring down at what was left of her behind me some one gasped others sobbed not in grief for her certainly but in fear of what i would do to them for the moment i could do nothing think nothing as the all too familiar agony washed over and through me once more i stood unable to move for a very long time staring at her sweet face her sweet lovely face in the final repose that only the truly dead no in this life she had been known as alina an orphan raised with others in the village her true name though she had not known it not known it until i had come along and begun my courtship of her was tatiana finding her alive again had been my greatest joy awakening her hidden memories of her past life my greatest pleasure i had fallen in love with our almost one hundred years ago when i had walked free and breathing in the sunlight she had been betrothed to my younger brother sergey and thought herself in love with him until the night of their wedding the night when i had bargained away all that i had all that i was so that i might have her for my own that night my brother had died by my hand his blood running like living fire in my veins that night i had gone to her and touched her with true passion given her a glimpse of what real love could be but in her inexperience the intensity of it had frightened her and she had retreated into the safe memory of sergei she had run away some have said it was from me because of what i had become but she had gone mad with grief from sergey his death and threw herself from the castle balcony which overlooked the valley below it had been full of mist i had watched it silently swallow her frail white clad form and wished for death to swiftly visit me as well but despite the best efforts of my enemies i had not died i had survived while they perished i had survived to exist but not to live never again to live not until decades later when i recognized the face and form of my tatyana born once more into the world did a semblance of life return to my soul she was then a village orphan adopted by a lecherous burgomaster looking to make her his wife they had called her marina but i had known her true identity before i could take her away to her rightful place at my side the bastard had murdered her with my bare hands i had executed him,1

B078SHBJSM,you're wasting your time the man said in a gruff voice pushing his white cowboy hat back and arching an eyebrow i'm not even sure why they sent the feds were case like this sonora stopped squaring her shoulders and preparing herself for an all too familiar argument that she didn't feel like having with his man in this parking lot it was too damn hot to have to justify herself but she knew that he wasn't going to let it go and it wouldn't be a typical case for without some one question ing why she was there at least this man was polite enough to call her ma'am while questioning her authority and the bureau's motivation it's not a waste of time she said trying to keep her tone light and even the last things you wanted to do was have him cite jurisdiction enforcer out the case might not be important to him but it was important to her they all were she smiled doing her best not to patronise him even though he was already getting on her nerves he'd been hovering over her for the entire time she'd been going through the abandoned car in the parking lot of the sonic in glen rose texas and she was about sick of his constant blathering look i get it she said finally i understand that this isn't a priority for you and it's all right if you have better things to do i can take it from here and i'll take down the tape when i leave if that will make it easier but we're here and we're going to spend our time and resources on this missing person until we've finder no one is asking you to tag along and if you want to deal with the media when this is all over i'm more than happy to keep my name out of the papers she didn't say it outright but the implication was clear he could have all the glory and sonora would be happy to do all the work as long as he stayed out of her way the sheriff stood a little taller his slight potbelly leading the way as he continued pacing in the adjacent parking stall to the white four door sedan that sonora was inspecting for any clues that might help her find the missing woman who owned the car she heard him chuckle and before he could say anything she knew what was coming she rolled her eyes behind her dark sunglasses but he couldn't see or do it way the man said vibrating like a misfiring engine as he chortled well miss you look like one person to me you've got a mouse in your pocket young lady sonora ignored the dig in him pointing out that she looked about a decade younger than twenty seven she wasn't here for this and if he thought she was some wet behind the ears agent looking to prove herself on a pointless case that was his problem she was here for eddie thompson and her family and that was it everyone else could go kick raw rocks as far as sonora was concerned,0
B07FQWDTQM,after sex we discuss the use of vivid descriptions stakeholder vignettes and narratives told through the various lenses of our ten element model chapter seven covers our approach to generating concepts and developing alternative architectures in other words discovering what is possible for future architecture chapter eight on the process and techniques for evaluating these possible architectures focuses on the difficult decision of choosing the future architecture in chapter nine we present a technique for checking alignment in the future architecture we discuss implementation planning as well as communicating the new architecture to stakeholders chapter ten tells the story of a recent enterprise architecting project while every architecting endeavor is unique this chapter provides a sense of how the aries framework is used in real world practice to produce a blueprint for the future chapter eleven presents our seven architecting imperatives the fundamentals we believe should be part of every enterprise transformation project regardless of the specific framework or techniques used throughout the book we incorporate examples from many of the enterprise architecting projects we have been involved in at the end of chapters three through nine we include suggested exercises and questions for consideration which you can apply to your enterprise to enhance your understanding of the material in the book finally two appendixes are included in the bonus pdf to provide executive summaries of two additional architecting projects acknowledgments we would like to acknowledge the many graduate students who have participated in our classes and research programs too numerous to call out individually they have had a major role in what we have achieved and in shaping the material presented in this book many of their contributions made through graduate thesis work or referenced within we would also like to sincerely acknowledge the colleagues who spent time reviewing our materials and providing invaluable input and suggestions for improvement in particular we would like to acknowledge mark prendergast for his creative graphics and help in developing other materials over the past several years as we also extend a special thanks to our former doctoral student caroline lamb who worked with us in the early stages of organizing our materials for the book finally we would like to thank our family and friends for their encouragement and patients throughout this process one why architecting matters the beginning is the most important part of the work plato it is no surprise that enterprises that fail to keep up with the changing world around them are sooner or later doomed to failure this is precisely why enterprises periodically undertake planned transformations what is surprising is just how many enterprises falter and perhaps even fail to survive in spite of determined efforts to and or take the necessary change the process of transforming an enterprise is not simple there can be all sorts of known and unknown pitfalls throughout the entire journey but we can say one thing for certain a transformation initiative that does not begin well is not likely to end well the question then is how do we begin well there are many types of enterprises corporations government agencies startups nonprofits and universities to name only a few but we believe all enterprises share four fundamental characteristics first an enterprise consists of people who generate value for others by pr reducing a product and or performing a service of some kind second an enterprise is a whole system that has a purpose a reason for being this purposes evident in the enterprise's strategy stated or implied its way of doing things for example processes procedures is knowledge a way of organizing a culture for example a belief system trust openness and a way to measure itself for example prophets societal benefits third an enterprise benefits from being part of it's larger ecosystem the living environment in which it exists and operates fourth every enterprise must periodically undergo transformation as it evolves and adapts to an ever-changing world why enterprises transform enterprises are continually evolving this may be driven by changing needs desired growth or new opportunities and threats to existence for example new technology,0

B00BD9H0QY,the equation mountains were the tallest mountains gift had ever seen even though he had lived near them for the last five years he still marveled at their height and their power they're faintly red rock made him feel as if he were at home but their rounded peaks spoke of an age a timelessness that he hadn't seen anywhere else in the world he stood outside the students hut in the protectors village and waited for moto dawn had just touched the tips of the mountains the sunlight a pale yellow as it rose over the ancient peaks it would take another hour before the light reached him the village was quiet many of the sharman were already busy with their daily tasks others the night guardians slept it had taken him almost a year to get used to the rhythms of the protectors they gathered much of their food and the rest was brought to them by the nearby fe infantry garrison accustom that was hundreds perhaps thousands of years old no commerce took place here protectors village served two functions it housed the sharman dedicated to guarding the place of power and it gave the young apprentices a school of sorts a place to train where they would be undisturbed by the outside world fifty stone huts huddled on the plateau they were round and made out of mountain rock they had no windows and only one door some of the huts were built for several inhabitants like the students hut some were built for one person a full fledged chairman who had to buy rights i live alone gift wasn't a sherman yet and he wouldn't be for a long time he had decades of training ahead of him maddow his main teacher believed that he could cut his training short because of the power of his magic the unprecedented strength of his vision but she was only guessing there had never been an apprentice like gift in the entire history of the fey his magic was unique his heritage was unique and because of those things his future was uncertain he rubbed his hands together in the early morning chill maddow had instructed him to wear only his apprentices robes she was going to take him to the place of power several years before most apprentices were ever taken it was said that a goat herder found this cave and took his family inside when they came out they were fe simply entering the cave did not create to fe there was magic in a place of power that when tapped altered everything that much he knew without being taught he had discovered a second place of power fifteen years before and had lived in it for several weeks there he had seen things he still did not comprehend things that had changed his life forever he would not be standing here if he hadn't lived in that place he shifted from one barefoot to the other his toes were growing cold the bottoms of his feet had become hard from use he rarely wore shoes they were frowned upon by the sharman but usually he was moving he almost never stood still the motto saw that as a flaw she saw many things about him as flaws he had been raised by adoptive parents who had no idea how to control his visionary magic and he had used his talents in ways that the sherman here frowned upon that his spells had been successful didn't matter now nor did the fact that with them he had saved hundreds of lives that he had misused the magic was the important thing the thing they wanted to corral in him wild magic or so maddow called it she said his wild magic and his impatience were his greatest faults until he had come here he thought his wild magic was his greatest asset he hadn't even known he was impatient until he had come to a place where time seems to have stopped there were no regular schedules as there had been when he lived in a fe military camp no rhythms as there had been when he lived in the rural areas of his homeland blue i'll hear the sherman went about their business as if they were being governed from within he always felt at loose ends he wanted to stay busy although sometimes there was nothing to do maddow said he had to get used to quiet he thought that the most difficult thing of all he glanced up the mountainside the place of power was a morning's climb from the protectors village from here he could see the silvery shimmer that marked the cave's entrance his stomach jumped slightly he had no idea how different this place of power would be from the one he discovered on blue i'll and blue isle the place of power contained items from the isles main religion rocha aneurysm but real aneurysm wasn't practiced anywhere on this continent known as viel here at the foundation of the fe empire the word religion wasn't used at all finally he saw the door to my does hut open she stepped outside and sniffed the air as she always did as if the faint fragrances on the breeze gave her information that gift could never get to him all the smells were familiar the dusty sharpness of the mountains them's selves the pungent odor of the seater plants that grew perennially behind the students hunt the stench of the manure that he and the other students had spread on the communal garden just the night before nothing stood out and nothing was unexpected,1

B00CS97LNU,irritable but even if the nice evening self was a fake i still gave him points for trying i heard carol jean awaken him in the next room but not as tenderly as she had awakened me moments before she knew the difference between us read granted a reply and stumbled toward the bathroom sounded like a morning i should stay away from him for at least an hour i went to the kitchen and tore open three bananas for breakfast when i returned to the sleeping area both the girls were awake emmy like all human babies was completely useless and incompetent even now that she was old enough to walk she was wet but instead of taking her soggy diaper off she just stood there crying doing nothing to help nothing to even cooperate as carol jean struggled to get her into fresh clothes humans are born so stupid but that's the script their dna has prepared for them so i didn't blame emmy in fact as a cool dispassionate observer i couldn't help but notice that most of the difficulty was caused by carol jean's incompetence at dressing her own child child as much as i loved carol jean i had to admit that red was a better mother than she was red could have sued demi in a moment and in the meantime he could flip clothes onto a child as fast as he dealt cards carol jean on the other hand made everything twice as hard as it needed to be and every sound that emi made only exasperated her more i may be a witness but that doesn't mean that i'm not allowed to help i distracted emmy from the task at hand entertaining her with meaningless chatter and funny faces almost at once the little girl forgot her discomfort you are my hero of locke said carol jean if only she had really believed her own words the older daughter lydia wasn't as easy to pacify love lots watching me get dressed she complained when i turned my attention to her he keeps staring at me to not look at me tell him yourself lydia he isn't staring he's only being friendly i didn't understand this human obsession with privacy and modesty what did lydia in her little prepubescent brain suppose that i had some interspecies hankering for her neotenists immature body i knew where i was wanted turning my back on lydia i reached for emmy she held out her arms for me i clambered into her clumsy embrace and held my breath as she hugged me with dangerous enthusiasm the real benefit of this was that it always made lydia crazy with jealousy when i let 'em me hug me i want a hug too she wailed please don't get them competing with each other lovelock carol jean said not today i scrambled out of emi's hug and climbed over carol jean to get to lydia who was reaching for me with a look of coy triumph on her face poor child she thought she was the one manipulating me once and folded in her false little embrace i permitted myself an audible sigh carol jean was usually oblivious to how much i endured for her sake but i still tried to help her notice already i had heard read grumble emi cry and lydia wine and reds parents weren't even awake yet not for the first time i wished that carol jean ny were going to the arc without the rest of her family if i could have thought of a way to do it i would have as carol jean clumsily took care of the girls setting them at the table where they splashing lee ate their cold cereal i settled myself in a corner to do my job recording how carol jean spent her last morning on earth i thought it was appropriate to see that she dressed herself only after her children were dressed and ready to go ate only after her children had eaten the leading scientist of her time and still she placed her children before the weighty concerns of her work thus did the greatest of all gynaecologists have numbly act out her natural role within the species she had said it herself once dialysis must always recognize that they are part,1
B0777RW3Z4,there was something inherently sadistic about a teacher who sprang a pop quiz on her students the friday before a long holiday weekend that thought was firmly in megan's mind even as she cast a surreptitiously reproachful glance at the teacher in question mrs shaw surprisingly spry and feared by most of the student body even in her late sixties before looking back down at her test paper the empty workspace at the bottom of the page was decorated with a steady progression of butterflies and flowers rather than the sums that had been intended for climbing up into the margins in elaborate spirals and twining branches frankly she thought her designs looked better than a bunch of math busy work would have but she hadn't meant them to take up quite as much of the test paper as they had mrs shaw wasn't exactly the type to approve of doodling on her quizzes as if summoned by your thoughts a shadow fell across her desk making the teenager winds barely a second before the teacher's voice broke the stillness i see mister blackwell isn't the only one having trouble remembering what class he's in this afternoon unbidden megan found herself looking across the room to the trim figure of the boy sitting in the back row only having enough time to get a glimpse of the name students short blonde hair before their teacher continued with her recrimination though to his credit he did at least finish his exam before choosing to express his artistic side scattered laughter greeted that particular remark and meg felt a flush darken her skin even as she raked her gaze back over the rows of math problems bracketed by her sketches she'd made an attempt to genuinely solve some of them but just as many others had had hastily sk scribbled guesses put below them and still others had been left blank entirely there was a reason why math was her least favorite subject maybe an afternoon in detention will be enough of a reminder for you too that while art has it's place that place is not in my class but it's friday the protest i rate and immediate escaped her throat before she could stop it earning a sharp enough look from the elderly woman to cause the words that would have followed it to die before she had the chance to form them correction mister blackwell will remain in class for thirty minutes of detention you miss conroy i'll see in my office when the bell rings is that clear it took a visible effort for her to bite back the retort that wanted badly to free itself from her lips but bite it back she did yes ma'am the words were quiet and more than a little curt but to megan's relief they were enough to satisfy mrs shaw as the teacher returned to her own desk meg looked back across the room at the blonde haired boy who was going to be sharing in her punishment albeit in a lesser form me and my big mouth she thought darkly feeling a bit mollified when she saw the sympathetic glance her fellow doodler was tossing in her dear erection she gave him a grateful smile and then turned her head to gaze instead out the classroom window in a mute echo of her current mood the sky was a dark ominous gray a strong breeze shaking the bare limbs of the old oak standing in the school yard large flakes of snow beginning their slow descent towards the ground as she watched i'm just not sure what else to do with you miss conroy for the past twenty minutes or so megan had been fighting and thankfully succeeding to keep her temper under control she wasn't an especially volatile person by nature but there was just something about the woman sitting in front of her that had rubbed her the wrong way from the first day she'd been in her class i've spoken to the principal and your parents and nothing any of them have told me has helped explain why you find it so difficult to behave in my class you're not having any problems at home you're getting good grades in all your other classes mrs shaw paused then taking her glasses off for a moma nt and affording the teenager a better look at her narrow watery blue eyes you're a smart girl you're not lazy either so please tell me what the problem is,1

B0725RR2J7,it's a commonplace and the font of a thousand jokes that many people don't trust lawyers what may be less widely appreciated is that lawyers themselves don't often trust their own partners in their own firms yes i have personally encountered this staggering phenomenon all too often the most exquisitely distilled expression of how the inside of a law firm can be a trust free zone was delivered by a partner who may it's hard to tell have thought he was being either clever or elusive when i asked point blank whether he trusted his partners the question isn't whether i'd trust any of them or not in fact it's that i don't want to have to trust them you might think that in discussions about a firm's strategic direction trust is secondary a peripheral nice to have so long as competence and capability are given not so at least not when it comes to communicating about critical topics and we have a study out of princeton university to prove it the authors pulled adults about their views of common american jobs on the dimensions of warmth trustworthiness and capability competent lawyers rank on a par with prostitutes when it comes to trust the authors labeled a cluster including lawyers ceos accounts etc as ambivalently perceived high competence but low warmth and echo our thought that being seen as competent but cold might not seem problematic until one recalls that credibility requires not just status and expertise but also trustworthiness warmth blah why because audiences viewed trustworthiness as the motivation to be truthful how can it be that in surprising numbers lawyers don't even trust each other it's actually predictable they were trained that way dr larry richard a friend is by all accounts the leading expert at the moment on and as he calls on his online side what makes lawyers tick in other words the singularly distinctive psychology of lawyers dr richard was a trial lawyer for ten years and then earned a phd in psychology at temple university for the past thirty years he's worked with law firms on a range of people issues here's what he has to say emphasis supplied about lawyers and the personality trait labeled skepticism which is the opposite of a trusting nature people high in skepticism are low interest and vice versa i've been gathering data on lawyers personalities since the early nineteen eighties personality traits are typically measured on a percentile scale ranging from zero percent to one hundred per cent when large samples of the general public are tested individuals scores on a given trait typically form a classic bell curve with them mean average for any given trait hovering around the fiftieth percentile but lawyers are different as i've written about elsewhere there are a number of traits on which lawyers tend to score much higher or much lower than the general public in short we're outliers the most extreme of all these outliers tray it's the one on which lawyers consistently score higher i e above the mean than all others is skepticism people with a very high skepticism score tend to look at the world through a glass half empty lens they focus on problems rather than what's working well they tend toward the suspicious they assume the worst and rarely give others the benefit of the doubt they wonder what another person's real motive might be for any action that person takes they question any assertion made by another person and they tend to be slower to trust others skepticism is so high among lawyers first because the personality trait of skepticism provides an important advantage to any lawyer by making critical thinking more natural and easier people with high levels of skepticism are more likely to be attracted to the law in the first place it feels more like a natural fit than many other jobs might so the legal profession starts out with an over representation of skeptics second for the same reason as above i e the degree of fit between the person and the job those lawyers with low skepticism scores tend to drop out of law school and out of law practice usually in their early years at a higher rate than do those with high skepticism sc coors this concentrates the herd and results in a more overall skeptical cohort of lawyers who remain in practice finally skepticism increases over time because lawyers work in a skeptical environment,0
1405542594,a more than eleven million survived to landfall in the americas that oceanic journey the middle passage of popular parlance was a unique and hellish experience which left deep seated physical and personal scars on every african who stepped ashore in the americas it was a brutal the transportation the memory of which lay at the heart of all slave communities and was refreshed year after year by new groups of africans joining existing slave communities fresh from the atlantic crossing the africans and their descendants born in the americas were kept at work by system of control and management that was ruthless callous and extremely brutal those who stepped out of line slaves who resisted or refused to comply was subject to a range of draconian punishments there was moreover nothing secret about how the slave system worked what happened on the slave ships and plantations was openly discussed both in the american colonies and in the european heartlands yet the severity and cruelties of slavery went largely unchallenged for much of it's history there were it is true occasional doubts raised about slavery from the early days but criticisms of cruelty or about whether slavery was an efficient labor system were isolated voices drowned out by the commercial success of the system morality and religion counted for little when weighed in the balance against the huh huge commercial benefits generated by slavery the well being and development of western societies from around the seventeenth century was in large measure paralleled by their involvement with slavery for more than two centuries slavery marched in step with western material progress though other factors were also at work notably the west sub realty to tap possessions and trading systems in africa india and asia but slavery stood out as the dominant form of labor that alone seemed capable of bringing the luxuriant lands of the americas to profitable cultivation it was a form of slavery chattel slavery like no other either the africans toiling in the americas had been bought and traded each with a price on his or her head from africa to the slave ships from the key sides of the americas to auction blocks and sales rooms clean across the caribbean and the continental mainland's they found themselves inherited and bequeathed exchanged and bartered just like other items of trade in any commercial transactions the surviving paperwork of slavery provides stark evidence of this at every turn in slave ships logs the ship's masters tabulated africans by number not by name in plantation ledgers show the plant is listed their slaves alongside the beasts of the field nor was this merely the march of impersonal economics the slaves status as an object as an item of trade was supported by the law legislation and courtrooms on both sides of the atlantic gave legal shit shape to slavery the essential heart of this range of legal transactions from people laugh through diplomatic agreements to a multitude of statutes was the status of the african slave as an item of trade as things just as the lord shaped the origins and development of slavery it also pronounced the formal death sentence on slavery when the slave trade was banned and when slaves were emancipated each step involved changes in the law legislation proclamations court cases and constitutional changes confirmed formal freedom but that tells only one side of a complex story when black f freedom was viewed in this light it was even possible to regard emancipation as a gift conferred on the slaves by others but what we need to know is why those changes came about behind the various legal enactments of freedom lay deep seated changes and attitudes toward slavery and at the heart of those changes were the actions of the slaves themselves if we focus not on the emancipated and their political backers but on the slaves if we considered slave emancipation as an aspect of slave activity as something that took place because of what the slaves did the story of emancipation begins to look quite different what follows then isn't attempt to explore how slaves with a critical element in securing their own freedom,0

B002VA9BKC,after it has started can customers react in a meaningful way to what you have after which you can begin to see how your trajectory must be altered to truly interact with their wants and needs it is a course in whitewater rafting not transoceanic navigation that has been taught in silicon valley boston seattle and other high tech strongholds and that's just fine until you reach the ocean the broader domain of continuous improvement to establish systems the world of traditional business it is here that silicon valley will be challenged during the coming decade no other place on the planet has had more success in market formation and in the generation of market capitalization but both these disciplines are forward looking both imply that one can assign stock market value today to competitive advantages that must be executed against tomorrow silicon valley companies have been unmatched in their ability to generate extra very competitive advantages that if market valuations are to be believed will give them above average returns four six eight ten years to come i for one believe those advantages are indeed sustainable over those periods but only if the cultures that bred them can step up to the challenge of becoming enduring institutions here i pause for i myself do not like the breathlessness of silicon valley i do not like it's hyper connected communication style i do not like it's insistence on being young and hip and hot and hyped i have this vision of thoreau and emerson and whitman and dickinson all calling out to us all trying to wave us away from some collision course with what i do not know but i am nervous about it here is where i think the significance of silicon goldrush comes in we are indeed in the midst of a gold rush with all the implications that phrase calls to mind such good fortune does limit one's options you cannot go slowly on the way to sutter's mill and expect to find much when you get there the pace is forced by the situation as much now as it was one hundred and fifty years ago and that pace in turn has brought into existence new patterns of wealth formation new ways to partner and compete new modes of recruiting managing and retaining employees new ways of conceive during the employment relationship in the context of hyper growth markets i believe these new modes are right on the mark so the world around the technology industry should take note and take notes and after well there's still a lot of here and now to get through first but one thing is sure the strategy of standing back of holding these new methods and disdain of dissociating oneself and one's enterprise from them causes failure in business as in football the west coast offense is here to stay and east coast establishment and other economies around the world must absorb it and respond to it not reject it reading and reacting to the ideas in this book is a great way to start but in so doing each of these other economies needs to find it's own expression of the insights accumulated here one that integrates traditional strength with new learning we do not need silicon prairie or silicon forest or silicon alley drop the silicon we need some new element from the periodic table how silicon valley pundits frequently like to note attributing the notion to picasso great artists do not copy they steal finally for those of us who live and work in silicon valley this book is a currency check the ideas in it are what's happening today if they are unfamiliar to you get with them if you think you've got them you're getting jaded and you'd better look again there are still a lot of miracles to come from silicon valley jeffrey moore is chairman of the chasm group a consulting firm in san mateo california and a venture partner in more david dao ventures he is author of crossing the chasm inside the tornado and the gorilla game an investor's guide to picking winners in high tech introduction the new gold rush in january eighteen forty eight gold nuggets were first discovered in the american river near the town of coloma california the effects of that discovery were felt for decades after it was not just a matter of the wealth generated by the mining of the precious metal itself more than two billion dollars worth before it was depleted the gold industry caused a whole infrastructure of other industries to spring up around it employing suppliers and partner nurse and advisers and distributors in a sayers and many others it even hastened statehood for california just as important the gold rush helped to seed the idea that it is possible through a combination of good luck hard work and technology to get rich quickly tens of thousands of would be millionaires poured into california from all over the world but very few of these miners actually the struck it rich they found that the work was tougher than they had expected and that the chances of any individual hitting it big were very small in nineteen ninety eight hundred and fifty years later we are experiencing a similar frenzy of commercial activity that i call the silicon goldrush meaning the industry these companies and markets that have sprung up around the essential ingredient of the digital revolution silicon it to originated in california and centers now in the companies of silicon valley south of san francisco although there are significant outposts in areas like seattle boston new yo york and austin texas just as the california gold rush opened a whole new market and created a whole new mindset so the silicon goldrush has changed the face of american and global industry and spawned the creation of a set of industries and businesses that support and surround it equally as important the companies involved in the silicon goldrush structure themselves and conduct their business in substantially even radically different ways than companies that we think of as traditional by which i mean the division allies hierarchies that have been the norm in this country for many decades the success of these silicon based companies from the tiniest startup to the grandfather of them all hewlett packard has deeply influenced traditional organizations and forced them to think about and often adopt the new ways of operating everywhere you looked a day older companies and those in traditional industry you are adopting the organizational structures business strategies and operational methods of the silicon valley gang in other words the technology companies are changing more than the markets in which they operate they are transforming the way america does business in this book i explore these new structures strategies and methods through the stories of twenty three technology companies most of them based in silicon valley itself for a number of reasons i have chosen a startup venture cross world software to take a starring role in the book the story of this fledgling corporation contains many of the elements that make the technology industry so exciting and instructive to watch they include the scramble for financing the glitzy launch events the feverish jamming to move the initial product from design to manufacture and into hands of paying customers the spin cycle the combination of self promotion and media hype that can create a perception of momentum even before there is actual movement the colorful cast of characters the non traditional work environment the high stakes and big money the meteoric growth the constant risk of failure radical change takeover by out and burn out i have been following the silicon scene and the companies that compose it for more than a decade first as a business writer for the san francisco chronicle and over the past six years with upside magazine it has been fascinating and thought provoking to get to know these companies intimately through repeated visits to their sites interviews with key players both inside and outside the companies and through my research into their past their performance and their prospects my goal for this book has been to synthesize what i have observed over the past decade and what i have learned in more than one hundred in-depth interviews with the executives of the twenty three companies and with other knowledgeable observers of high technology the result is ten chapters and a conclusion and each of which focuses on a key issue that pertains to all of these companies to a greater or lesser degree and that also has relevance to businesses and organizations outside the world of technology,0

B002UZYWNY,and in one way or another practically every one in our family has been an entrepreneur in nineteen thirty eight my dad's grandfather harry g johnson sr started his car dealership magic city ford roanoke earned the nickname magic city just before the dawn of the twentieth century when the convergence of several major railways ushered in an explosion of jobs and the city's population boomed from six hundred to five thousand in just two years harry sr son harry jr my grandfather eventually took over the business and in nineteen seventy two his son bill my dad started out washing windows and worked his way up eventually take taking the reins when harry jr retired my mom's dad hugh jones ran a wholesale food distribution business called roanoke restaurant service he died when my mom anne was just thirteen her mom dot took over the business after graduating from high school my mom started college but soon dropped out to run the company she did quite well building the company to about thirty million dollars in annual sales by the time she sold it to you as food service in the early nineteen eighties it was always clear to me that my parents loved their work and relished building something of their own that they could be proud of talking about their businesses with each other was everyday conversation and they made a huge impression on me they weren't frustrated about their work and they didn't come home full of stress they were happy enough with their work that they they wanted to share the doings of the day with each other and with me too including me in the day to day flow of their businesses was normal for them because that's what their parents had done when my mom was little her parents kept a cot for her at their office so she could nap whenever she needed to and when she wasn't at school chances were good she'd be at the office doing her homework reading or napping on that cot sometimes i wonder how much business conversation soaked in while she slept my parents even took me with them sometimes on their business trips my mom always considered travel a valuable education interview learning how to adapt to different customs and cultures and styles of interaction was every bit as important as academic learning they traveled a lot for my dad's business and even as a very young boy i was often allowed to accompany them to meetings while i didn't understand everything they were talking about i got to experience the life and shop talk of a business owner and i loved it maybe the most important thing i learned from them about being an entrepreneur was something my dad used to say if you love what you do you'll never have to work a day in your life some people never get around to starting their own business out of the fear that it's too difficult or that the risks are too high and the chances of success are too daunting don't believe it starting your own business is hard work but it's not rocket science i started my first company with no real business training and almost no money and although i had entrepreneurial parents they never funded any of my businesses or helped me run them the truth is building a successful business is more about common sense and the right attitude than it is about any kind of special training or inherent talents and the risks part of being an entrepreneur is learning how to take only those risks you can afford you don't have to take out loans or go into serious debt to build a successful business i've never taken a single business loan from a bank or from my parents risk is definitely part of the game but you can take calculated risks without risking your shirt you can make plenty of profit with a fairly so small operation then leverage those earnings by using them to build your next enterprise growing your financial base step by step as you build your knowledge base i've launched more than a dozen successful businesses and never lost a cent this is not just luck i've watched my expenses carefully used com nonsense and have never taken foolhardy risks during the internet bubble years a lot of entrepreneurs let their growth and projections get away from them they lost touch with the core everyday realities of business and as a consequence when the bubble burst hundreds of thousands of people lost money in some cases millions practically overnight people then ran scared from the internet because so many lost so much during those few years and it wasn't just those involved in dot coms who lost millions of people who worked at more traditional companies had invested their money in these new dotcom stocks or had their four o one ks invested aggressively in technology mutual funds and they all lost money too the whole country lost money and for the next few years everybody was afraid of internet companies i was fortunate during that time several of my businesses road those same growth trends on,0

1541438736,no her dark hair was cut short it matched the color of mali shoulder length curls so well they could be sisters i was head over heels in love with jean almost from the first moment we had met and the joy on her face as she studied molly made me love her even more tom asked you people all live in here he looked around at the sparse surroundings of the entry room and into the adjoining area we called the decontamination room the chief gave a deep chuckle and said not in here tom you'll see where in a few minutes i sealed the big outside door in the place and gestured for our new guests to go ahead of us into the next room they moved hesitantly through the door and tom studied the room that looked more like a locker room than anything you could live in uncle titus my sometimes crazy survivalist benefactor who had left me this shelter in his will probably expected this outer room to be needed for decontamination after a nuclear war rather than a zombie apocalypse that's why there were showers for washing off after going outside and special suits with breathing apparatus us and radiation monitors attached to them he also probably considered the possibility of a biological war but i seriously doubt it he gave much thought to zombies will be going through this room into the main part of the shelter said kathy but first we have some unpleasant business to take care of unpleasant business asked tom what kind of unpleasant business as he had one hand loosely hanging near the back of molly's head and he gently drew her closer to his left leg she sensed his tension and looked up at him with a slightly frightened expression gene reacted immediately and went down onto one knee in front of her to make eye contact don't be afraid sweetie there's nothing here that can hurt you said jean kathy had succeeded in getting the rubber band out of her ponytail so her long blonde hair had fallen free the effect on tom bergmann was obvious because the thought of unpleasant business suddenly didn't seem to be making him quite as tense the chief had been quiet other than his brief response to tom a minute earlier and i could tell he was thinking ahead to the same question we had to broach when he kathy and jean at first floated into the vicinity of my boat while i had been out doing some target practice i had a boat a shelter and plenty of guns but i didn't know how to shoot so i had to take the boat far enough from shore to get some target practice where i wouldn't be heard by the infected dead that were wandering around in the dense coastal trees after a bit of practice with the guns i found myself facing a raft carrying two attractive women and a mountain of a man who was wearing some kind of uniform as a matter of fact so were the women but the blonde was dressed as a cop and the cute pixie with a dark hair was dressed as a nurse in hospital scrubs we had faced the same unpleasant business at that chance meeting as we were facing now but with a child and a protective father in the room it wasn't going to be quite as funny as it had turned out to be on that day i had asked if any of them had been bitten and gene had immediately begun pulling off her clothes to show she was ok she was completely natural about it probably because she was a nurse but i felt like some kind of pervert i had stopped her from stripping which had made me look good in their eyes but it was still a dumb move in more ways than one cute or not the world had changed and he couldn't just take someone's word that they hadn't been bitten this time there wouldn't be any joking about it and we had to be careful if molly had been bitten tom was going to protect her if tom had been bitten we were going to be faced with making a very unpleasant decision to go along with the unpleasant business none of us had thought it through before rushing out to the houseboat and bringing tom and molly the inside but if he was hiding a bite from an infected dead he would become dangerous to us all the only alternative would be ugly cathy made from eye contact with tom and asked were you or molly bitten by any of those infected dead out there tom understood immediately why we were all watching for his reaction but that may only have been because he knew the consequences of the wrong answer he looked from kathy to the chief then toward me and gene out of reflex he pulled his daughter behind him it was the reflexive move that made me realize what he possibly did for a living before the infection had spread like wildfire around the world combined with his athletic build his fast but smooth reflexes made him appear ready to move in any direction in a split second i remembered an interview i had heard on t v when chipper jones had retired from baseball and the reporter asked derek jeter to describe chipper jones,1
1400170311,i dream or hope has been present from the start ever since we became an independent nation each generation has seen an uprising of ordinary americans to save that dream from the forces which appeared to be overwhelming it writing in the early years of the great depression the book was published as the epic of america in nineteen thirty one adams sensed he was living on the cusp of such an uprising possibly the greatest of these struggles lies just ahead of us at this present time not a struggle of revolutionists against the established order but of ordinary men to hold fast to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness which were vouchsafed to us in the past envision and on parchment as it turned out adams was deeply disillusioned by franklin roosevelt and his new deal feeling they represented a betrayal of american traditions of autonomy and a case of government collusion and the creation of a soulless materialistic consumer society though he would remain popular for the rest of the decade adams was increasingly out of step with the temper of his times and he died disappointed with his country in nineteen forty eight in retrospect it seems odd that adams was talked out of his wish to call his most popular book the american dream while it's not clear whether he actually coined the term or appropriated it from someone else his publishers reluctance to use it suggests american dream was not in widespread use elsewhere in any event adams invoked it over thirty times in the epoch of america and the phrase rapidly entered common parlance as a by word for what he thought his country was all about not only in the united states but in the rest of the world so in this regard it is notable that the addition of the book i happened to pluck off the shelf at the harvard college library came from a nineteen forty one edition stamped as the property of an army educational supervisor stationed in europe the american dream had become a weapon in the fight against hitler and later stolen one can i only wonder that there was once a moment when the words american dream could be dismissed as obscure or unappealing times change when in an early phase of this project i types those words into a library catalog i got back over seven hundred titles education and the american dream tenants and the american dream advertising the american dream the american dream and the p popular novel the endangered american dream prisoners of the american dream and so on none of the books i looked at makes anything like a systematic attempt to define the term or trace it's origins it's definition is virtually taken for granted it's as if no one feels compelled to fix the meanings and uses of a term everyone presumably understands which today appears to i mean that in the united states anything is possible if you want it badly enough actually american dream has long since moved beyond the relatively musty domain of print culture into the incandescent glow of the mass media where it is enshrined as our national motto jubilant athletes to claim had following championship games aspiring politicians invoke it as the basis of their candidacies otherwise sober businessmen side achieving it as the ultimate goal of their enterprises the term seems like the most lofty as well as the most immediate component of an american identity a birthright far more meaningful and compelling than terms like democracy constitution or even the united states the omnipresence of the american dream stems from a widespread though not universal belief that the concept describes something very contemporary at the same time however much of it's vitality rests on a premise which i share that it is part of a long tradition in this view pilgrims may not have actually talked about the american dream but they would have understood the idea after all they lived at as people who imagined a destiny for themselves so did the founding fathers so did illiterate immigrants who could not speak english but intuitively expressed rhythms of the dream with their hands ones and their hearts what alexis de tocqueville called the charm of anticipated success,0

1785728849,the mountain air trembled with a squeal of splitting wood as the outer stockade succumbed to the greedy flames the fire was not natural for no natural flame burned the color of pus natural fires left ash in their wake not virulent shrieking mold it was a fire aroused by sorcery and only sorcery could snuff it but there was no time and in any event there was no one among the drac who possessed the strength to do so not even their war leader tamara van drac voice vote of the drac oldest of the high clans of the rictus clans felt her soul wither as the great hall where she'd been born collapsed with a groan lodge poles burned like torches and the skulls of three generations screamed useless warnings to their living kin from their rooftop perches the fires spread like a thing alive leaping from peaked log to thatched roof without pause back get back she cried shoving her clans folk along away from the creeping flames and towards an ornately carved stone archway to the inner keep go her stream of frightened faces surrounded her pushing and shoving to escape the oily haze which preceded the plague fires the walls of the inner keep were high and sloped backwards surrounding the lodge houses of the high born as well as the great storehouses which fed her folk in the darkest months of winter and the icy wells which drew fresh water up from beneath the earth the walls had been built in centuries past by greater artisans than her people now possessed what few living warriors that remained to her clan were stationed there loosing arrow after arrow at the invaders once the last of her folk were safely through they would retreat down through the lich gates hidden beneath the lodge houses and within the great wells then along the secret paths that lead into the surrounding wilderness those ancient paths had been carved for this very contingency after the black days of the great awakening and they would be the salvation of her people if she could buy them the necessary time tamra held her ground letting her clans folk break and flow around her the enemy would be inside the outer palisade in moments and she intended to greet them with all due hospitality she was a daughter of the drac and could do no less she caught the edge of her chest plate and shifted it the armor was old and ill fitting digging into her flesh at inconvenient points and heirloom from the age of myth it had belonged to her father and had been handed down from one voice vote of the drac to the next four generations a stylized serpent one survey avid read but now a faded brown marked it's faceted surface it was the symbol of a fallen kingdom and have lost glories sister she glanced at her brother his empty eye sockets burned with which fire flames and his flashlight fingers clutched the hilt of his barrow blade tightly you should go they will be here soon his words echoed in her head like a freezing iron wind your responsibility tea is to the living leave this to the dead no supper we will meet them together she recalled the day he died to an arak blade and the ceremony that followed she had left his body on a high slope to be picked clean by scavenger birds and flesh eaters she had carved the sigils of rousing into his bones herself as he would have done for her as they'd both done for the dead who now surrounded them in a phalanx the old dead the love dead sons and daughters fathers and mothers the countless generations of the drac stirred to fight a new for hearth and home death was not the end for the drac they lived and died and lived again to serve their people and their god and they had done so since the coming of the undying king and the great awakening,1

B00BF17R8G,over half a century ago i grew up in lewiston a small town in western new york a few miles north of niagara falls on the canadian border as the falls can be seen from the canadian and american sides from different perspectives so can lewiston it is a sleepy town protected from the rest of the world geographically nestled at the bottom of the steep shale niagara escarpment on one side and the niagara river on the other the river's appearance however is deceptive while it seems calm rarely making waves it has deadly whirlpools swirling on it's surface which can suck anything into their vortices in seconds my father a pharmacist owned a drugstore in the nearby honeymoon capital of niagara falls my mother a math teacher by training rather than inclination was an active participant in the historical society lewiston actually had a few historical claims to fame which my mother eagerly hyped the word cocktail was invented there charles dickens stayed overnight at the frontier house the local inn and lafayette gave a speech from a balcony on the main street our home which had thirteen trees in the yard that were planted when there were thirteen states was used to billet soldiers in the war of eighteen twelve it was called into action by history yet again for the underground railroad to smuggle slaves across the niagara river to freedom in canada my parents longed for a child for many years however when they were not blessed they gracefully settled into an orderly life of community service then i unexpectedly arrived the only child of suddenly bewildered older conservative devoutly catholic parents i seem to have been born eccentric a phrase my mother uttered frequently as a way of absolving herself of responsibility by today's standards i would have been labeled with attention deficit disorder a hyperactive child born with some adrenal problem that made her more prone to rough and tumble play than was normal for a girl fortune but lame i was born fifty years ago and simply called busy and bossy the possessor of an irish temper i was at the hub of the town because i worked in my father's drugstore from the age of four this was not exploitive child labor but rather what the town pediatrician prescribed when my mother explained to him that i had gone over the top of the playground swings making a three hundred and sixty degree loop and had been knocked unconscious twice ha had to be removed from a cherry tree the previous summer by the fire department done ed sullivan imitations for money at helm's dry good store all before i'd had kindergarten dr laughton dutifully wrote down all this information laid down his clipboard with certainty and said that i had worms and needed fletchers cast orea his foe fall back position in case when i was de wormed no hyperactive worms crept from any orifice was for me to burn off my energy by working at manual labor in my father's store he explained that we all had metronomes inside our bodies and mine was simply ticking faster than most i had to do more work than others to burn it off being in the full-time workforce at four gave me a unique perspective on life and i was exposed to situations i later realized were unusual for a child,0

B00JKOKUX4,colonel marcus p thorne party's military issued jeep at what appear to be an abandoned metal tool shed this was one of several old metal structures scattered amid an almost endless open space of desert near the ghost town of rawlings about eighty miles west of los alamos new mexico thorns scanned the open empty desert for only a moment before entering one of the nondescript worn out metal buildings with a faded yellow number twelve spray painted on the side thorne already knew this was the building he had to enter as well as the truth about this two thousand acres of government land that had literally hundreds of government employees working below his feet right at this very moment yes thorn a marine colonel had high enough clearance to know that the top secret underground military facility existed and how to get to one of it's many entry points but that was as far as his knowledge went prior to the zombie outbreak twenty seven months ago thornwood i've seen this desert as an ugly place of course this was compared to his home in lansing michigan where he had fish by his father's side as a boy on the state's many green grassy lakes today the town of lansing michigan was quite different it was the difference between night and day or what thorne assumed was the day difference between heaven and hell lansing was now infested with zombies as was much of the northern united states which was much different than the southern united states the far less zombie infested southern states were protected by the intra country border fence now the open desert of new mexico was void of corpses burning cars and the walking dead it had it's own beauty which was worth long thoughtful gazes this kind of beauty came with residual pain for thorn lansing was where thorne had met his late wife cindy as a freshman cheerleader at everett high school since d was his first and only true love with our short cheerleading skirt tan legs and bouncing blonde ponytailed hair what his wife and child still be alive today if they had moved till the south would his baby son william be running around and asking those simple but profound questions kids ask if they had simply lived in a run down shack in the middle of the new mexico desert thorns smiled as he thought of cindy calling him big boy billy thorns shook his head to clear his mind stop it he thought himself he could speculate about these things all day and in fact thoughts like these were always in the back of his mind the smallest things like a child's toy or every stinking time he saw a blond haired woman with a ponytail he had to tell himself not to yell out his wife's name he always felt like a fool as a very painful metal slide show of his family would unwind his mind time and time again it was a torment that thorne had competent metallized to survive service to his country had now become more than his job it was a diversion that kept him from insanity alas the mission was waiting and thorn would not keep it waiting any longer he pushed the thoughts of his lost family to the back of his mind as thorn enter the metal structure the blazer in sunlight of the august new mexico afternoon suddenly dissipated and his eyes adjusted thorne could see an empty room most likely a mechanic's garage in a former lifetime the shed had two additional rooms one marked latrine and most likely not used for decades and a second room marked by signs that said office this thorn opened the door to this room as previously instructed and behind the door was a long narrow hallway and a set of cement stairs that appear to go straight down as previously told thorne saw an old light switch on the wall to his right side when he flicked the switch a humming sound of a far off generator grumbled for a split second and then a series of lights powered on and a railing became visible on both sides of the stairs though and grab the rail as a descent down was awkwardly steep the one took the stairs at a steady pace passing door after door at regular intervals he did not try to open any of them that wasn't part of his orders instead he kept looking ahead waiting to see where the greeting party would arrive thorne knew he was approaching a mammoth underground military facility he could see his footprints through the accumulated dust that had collected on the pre world war two constructed stairs even so his approach was no doubt being monitored and any sign of her his presence topside had probably already been removed,1

earlier the year the reds invaded south korea every work day my father would rise at six thirty in the morning shave dress then grab a trolley and two buses to the company warehouse several miles away

building could stand taller than the peak of the surprise kingly ritzy hat crowning william penn's head atop philadelphia's anachronistic yet oddly beautiful city hall this may have been because the city fathers feared that if philadelphia ever forsworn conservative quaker roots and developed a skyline it would turn into new york philadelphians were both contemptuous and jealous of new york kurz they hated them personally but envy them in their storied metropolis philadelphians believed that new york was a great city whose inhabitants had done nothing to deserve it they resented new york's likened tropic relationship with the rest of the country feasting as it did in the fresh victims who pour off the buses at the port authority each day siphoning off all the talented energetic young people who had they stayed home in the hinterland might have made cities like philadelphia and pittsburgh and baltimore more like new york this was an attitude that would become more pronounced later when new yorkers against all odds will become even less likeable but by that time the city of brotherly love would have it's own skyline there was no question of my father's taking off work the day

length of time though he would argue otherwise this was mostly his fault strolling home jauntily after his first day on any new job with a smile on his face and a spring in his step suggesting that he had just had tea with the elector of saxony he would describe as superiors and coworkers as princes among men who are prepared to give you the very shirt off their back even though they had only just made your acquaintance they would continue to be described as shirt doffing stalwarts for several weeks their salt of the earth qualities sedulously catalogued every night their stature growing to olympian proportions with each passing hour but one day perhaps a month after taking the job he would have words with his boss or cross swords with a colleague or say the wrong thing to a customer and the next thing we knew he would be out on the street cursing the day his confreres is now unmasked as degenerates and his ignoble superiors no longer the lights in the piazza were born,0

B002V0LURO,arts and these were further subdivided into the trivium which were the first three and the quad rivian which were the advanced for the trivium was grammar rhetoric and logic the quadrillion was arithmetic geometry music and astronomy so you can see that right from the beginning of really all organized study language grammar and rhetoric was the real foundation of everything else now this was in the middle ages this was before the great linguistic discoveries of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and the study of language forms the base for everything else that we do now why is that well one reason is that language defines us as human all the old clear separations that we used to have between human and animal social organization altruism tool use are starting to become less clear scientists do more and more research it turns out that chimpanzees can use some tools and some birds can also that altruism shows up across the animal kingdom and that social organs asean is there in things like ants and termites as well as naked mole rats but language abstract language is uniquely human now you probably have heard about animal language studies and there's a lot of work that is done in this area and it gets a lot of publicity there's the famous washoe the chimp and nim chimp sky and koko the gorilla and kanzi the boner bo and alex the parrot and these animals get a lot of press and are up on the web and on tv but the very most advanced of all all of these animals does not even have the language ability of a two year old child that's a really important point to look at steven pinker makes an analogy that let's say you were studying elephants and you looked at the elephant's trunk and thought wow look at the amazing things this trunk can do and then instead of looking at the trunk itself you went and found some ancestral elephant that had a little stubby nose and notice that it was pushing peanuts around with that nose well that's the analogy he makes to have when we study animal language compared to human language animal language is like a a hyrax or a taper with little stubby nose and human language is a full elephant trunk that can do just about anything so it's nice to look at that animal material and there's been some breakthroughs with some of it but a lot of it's also very questionable but really we can can say that language abstract complex language with syntax is what separates humans from animals all of our cultural achievements rely upon language art athletics music we might do those things without language but as soon as we do we tell someone about them in language tech ecology and the proliferation of things like cell phones instant messaging email podcasts and voicemails all show that we just can't stop talking we love to talk and we even like to listen a little bit too another very important point is that language is a medium of communication it's how we communicate ideas but it's also a barrier to understanding there are over six thousand living human languages in the world that we're rapidly losing the smaller ones and anyone who's been in a place where they don't speak the language jj and were unable to communicate in an articulate complex fashion understands the frustration that comes from having separate languages we spend billions of dollars every year and many hours on translation and disasters happen because language isn't translated properly we struggled to learn new language says we've spent millions trying to come up with machines that can translate for us and this has had remarkably little success but in the end and there's a huge combinator real problem if you've got six thousand languages you have to find ways to communicate from each of those six thousand to the other five thousand nine hundred and ninety nine so you need a dictionary and a grammar book for each language in terms of each other language if you really were going to have full communication that's never happened instead what you have is a dictionary in terms of english or french or russian or one of the larger languages and then you go from a very small partially unknown language in say new guinea a to english and then from english to japanese and as we all know when we see things that have been translated multiple times you get a mass there you get very difficult problems with communication people putting enormous amounts of effort to learn new languages and although americans get a bad reputation for learning other languages in fact we spend billions of dollars and thousands and millions of hours learning new languages some of these languages have reputations for being particularly hard for example finnish has more than ten different noun cases that is you have to think of what each noun in the sentence is doing and put it into one of multiple categories,0

B002V8OCYY,the nation to yourself saud was the madeira and desert far to the south and so tear cell harrier and uncolored are set out on their journey but the gods of the wild magic were not yet finished with their weaving chapter one called to magic he'd never thought he'd see a unicorn harrier thought crossly and like so many things he thought he'd wanted to see when he was back in arm with aliyah like elves and dragons and wild mages the reality was nothing like he expected it to be though sure corrado was beautiful in fact she was the most beautiful thing he'd ever seen but he hadn't expected her to sucker him into falling into the stream with most of his clothes on and make him lose his shirt and then laugh or silly hat off about it just as if she were one of his idiot brothers of course maybe that was just what unit coins were like how would he know nobody in human lands had seen one since well since the time of the magic unicorn shulkin and kellen the poor orphan boy thinking about kellen a hero out of the nine city's most ancient legends made harrier shiver just a little and not with cold although he was soaking wet and the walk back to the wagon from the woods wasn't that pleasant in wet clothes but because only a fortnight ago he had been talking to the person who had taught that very hero to hold a sword who had helped the wild magic turn kellen into a knight made a great warrior who could defeat the and darkened with that thought the red leather satchel he had slung over his shoulders small as it was suddenly seemed incredibly heavy because it contained the three books of the wild magic brought to him not to tear herself to him by the unicorn coretta and if harrier could believe her did a unicorn tell lies he hadn't been granted the opportunity to become just an ordinary wild and age as if there could be such a thing but a night major just like the hero kellen had been nobody knew how kellen story ended though everyone knew how it began and everyone knew the ending of his sisters the blessed saint of dahlias she married the king of the elves so the tales went was granted immortality by the light and lived forever in the elven lands but over the last several moon turns harrier had learned a lot about how the stories he had always taken for granted as being well wonder tales which meant they were sort of true and sort of not were completely wrong about all the important things germain wasn't king of the elves just to begin with and elves certainly didn't live forever and having fought goblins and seen magical things that he had no name for met elves and dragons and all sorts of other folk that had left the lands of men in the time of the great flowering harrier thought he had gotten used to things being strange by now he and tears all had left arm with a leah almost four moon turns ago at the beginning of summer looking for a wild made you could put an end to terror cells little problem as harrier had thought of it then carousel said he was having visions harrier thought tear salah was having bad dreams but they really were visions and that was only the start of problems that just got worse and worse at least they had encountered are with him now because the elves had cast an incredibly powerful spell that they hadn't been sure at the time was even going to work to transfer and calendars bond from germane to tear cell because otherwise tear cell whether he was a high major or not wouldn't have the power he needed to cast his spells so now tears i'll have the power and all he had to do was learn all those spells so when he had gotten up this morning harrier had thought they only had two problems to deal with one was the fact that tierra cell kept saying that it took about twenty or thirty years to train a high major and he also kept saying that they didn't have that long before the darkness came back and the other was,1

B0037BUGL2,some forty one thousand men shuffled into the prison stockade at anderson station georgia between february of eighteen sixty four and april of eighteen sixty five of these perhaps twenty six thousand lived long enough to reach home theirs was undoubtedly the most unpleasant experience of the civil war but almost without exception those who wrote about andersonville appear to have exaggerated their tribulations of that place some did so deliberately for political reasons or simply because account of prison misery sold well in the postwar north others forgot personal acts of kindness regurgitating tales of horrible cruelties that they never witnessed because as one of them reasoned they must have been true in many cases they based their anecdotes on testimony from the trial of henry words the transcript of which was heavy with some of the most absurd heresy that any american judge ever permitted to stand literary demands may have driven former prisoners to enliven the recollections with grisly imaginings of borrowings if only to avoid infecting their readers with the sheer tedium of andersonville memories of their helplessness at the hands of their captors and crystallized suspicions that the deprivation was an act of conscious design may also have provoked a certain light essence with the truth these men did not however have to embellish their accounts to produce a picture of immense suffering the prison and the circumstances provided that without any infusion of malice much effort has been expended by various partisans to prove that southern spite against prisoners or northern intransigence on the exchange question was responsible for this tragedy surviving documents seemed to discredit any accusation of deliberate deprivation unless one takes the position that the richmond government should have devoted a greater proportion of it's dwindling resources to it's prisoners than to its own army but thorough examination of the exchange question would require the better part of a book this will not be that book ok clearly the breakdown of prisoner exchange was responsible for the lengthy imprisonments that allowed vitamin deficiency to kill and cripple so many but the real cause of that breakdown is less certain it was the federal government that suspended the exchange cartel first in response to disagreement over numbers and then in protests most of the confederate refused to repatriate black soldiers at one point it appeared that the two sides might work that out except perhaps for those prisoners who are recognized as former slaves but the federal government insisted on absolute equality for all black prisoners it could do no less without appearing to forsake them conversely as hungry for manpower as it was the confederacy could not comply without renouncing the very reason for it's existence northern stubbornness on that point puzzled equally resolute southerners leading them to suspect that this was merely an excuse for keeping the large preponderance of prisoners held in union prisons in the summer of eighteen sixty four ulysses grant let it slip that there was at least a grain of truth to that argument as hard as it was on those in southern prisons he contended it would be kinder to those still in the ranks if each side kept what prisoners had had since that would end the war sooner as important as the exchange question was to the prisoners the finer points of the debate do not bear particularly on what actually happened at andersonville it may not even be possible to determine whether the issue of black soldiers was a pretence or whether the more pragmatic motive evolved during the cartels suspension since intentions varied widely among those who held power grants implied policy of attrition was just as legitimate as the administration's stated motive was high minded if it was adherence to such a policy that led to the death of thousands who might otherwise have lived it probably saved even more lives that might have been lost north and south by prolongation of the conflict that would have been a tough bill of goods to sell in eighteen sixty five had grants reasoning been public knowledge even the principle of equal treatment for black prisoners held little sway with many in the north lincoln's own secretary of the navy privately denounced the obstinacy over former slaves the inhabitants of anderson v i felt particularly bitter on that account prison officials played the card for all it was worth prompting great numbers of prisoners to express contempt for the lincoln administration which they felt had abandoned them for the confiscated contraband back home many of the prisoners families share that sentiment it therefore behooves the victors to establish that enemy malevolence had cost it all rather than a matter of lofty principle or a conscious practical policy of the victim's own government that aim proved consistent with the politics of a bloody shirt and military justice prof out of the requisite scapegoat with that pronouncement one frail swiss immigrant went to the gallows and andersonville came to signify all that was evil in the heated confederacy,0

B002VA3F6I,how important it is to offer an antidote to that pressure at home i wanted to remind myself as much as anyone that there are alternatives to our culture's narrow definition of success and to suggest that would be doing all our sons and daughters a service if we had relinquished some of our collective anxiety over their unknown futures and simply trust them more to find their own way but as my two sons became teenagers themselves are stable orderly life flew apart instead of growing in wisdom i was searching for answers the idea of trying to offer anybody advice about anything seemed ludicrous when i tried to write what came out seemed messy and complicated as messy and complicated as our own everyday lives so i realized that i had a choice i could give up on my idea altogether or i could take a longer more circuitous route i could try to tell my own midlife story of living loving and letting go knowing that doing so would also mean owning up to all that i don't know all that i'm so still trying to figure out unlike the first book this one hasn't come easy for one thing writing about teenagers i soon realized is even harder than living with them they are extremely private creatures after all demanding of respect there were many lines i could not cross as for myself i'm not a parenting expert or a therapist or a teacher i'm just a mother confronting the challenges of middle age change loss a twenty one year old marriage children leaving home and none of it is smooth sledding all i really have to guide me these days is my own response joy gratitude sadness fear in the presence of all that seems most precious now as my two nearly grown sons strain inexorably against the ties that bind us it is of course a universal drama children grow up they leave home clocks tick and empty bedrooms and untouched gallons of milk turned sour in the fridge because no one's there to drink them parents mourn the loss and at the same time discover the will to reinvent themselves i know i'm not the first mother who's found it hard to let go who's yearned for change only to resist it when it comes who's found it painful at times to accept the fact that my sons are pulling away moving out into lives of their own nor will i be the last and so i offer the story of my mid life searching and mothering over the course of five unsettled years in the hope that other mothers will recognize aspects of themselves and remember that unique though our own experiences may be none of us really travels this path alone parenthood is what binds us our own doubts and questions awaken emma authy for parents everywhere and our fierce love for our children deepens our compassion for all children walking in the woods with a friend or gathered around a dinner table when the candles have burned low or sitting in a circle in a church basement we share our struggles open our hearts tell about our lives and our children's lives in an effort to make sense of things to learn the hidden truths of ourselves but also of course to share the small discoveries that may somehow ease the way for someone else this is how it's been for me chapter one change to exist is to change to change is to mature to mature is to go on creating oneself endlessly henri bergson when my children were small i would sometimes lie in bed in the early morning and try to envision the day ahead not the schedule we would keep or the activities in store but rather the attitude i wanted to bring to these things imagining myself being patient calm accepting i would create a picture in my mind of the mother i wanted to be for my two young boys of course at some point the day's challenges would always get the better of me jack would stick a beat up his nose and tell me it had magically disappeared henry would spill his third glass of orange juice in a row and i'd catch myself being impatient critical brusque not the kind of mother i'd envisioned at all back then i took comfort in knowing that when things got tough we could always regroup and start over i could take a deep slow breath put my cranky children into a tub full of bubbles toast bagels but the storm clouds blow over well the beat up the nose did require a trip to the e r still i felt so certain that tomorrow would be just another day another chance to try to get it right followed by another and another after that and hundreds more all more or less like the very day i was struggling to get through at that moment it seemed to me during those early years of child raising that my sons' childhoods would go on forever i couldn't imagine any life other than the one that const zoomed me right then a life shaped by the joys and demands of raising young children from the time my older son was three months old,0

B01FN1XBVA,midday light cut through the valley warming the otherwise chilly day sweat glistened on tetris chest and arms wanting it's way through the valley the breeze brought with it the smell of grass and growing things birds chirped in the distance he focused on the sensations hoping to distract from the growing tension that straightened his spine and caught at the nape of his neck when this didn't work he cast his gaze out over the village taking the familiar comforting sight might soothe him the valley's edges had been cleared of the woods making way for stepped crops allowing packed dirt and cobbled roads to wind through the busy village of jagan the building stood two stories at most in jagan a village that had spread out rather than up unlike many villages in the kingdom most of the roofs were stapled and shingled rather than thatched the rains on the edge of the rock mire forest were heavy with monsoons twice a year and thatch didn't hold up villagers meandered along the streets going about the varied tasks of the day though none came near the grassy clearing at the center of town there a massive wooden pole stood carved and polished to a near reflective sheen a glowing green crystal atop it the crystal pulsed with array rainbow of colors always returning to it's base green between flashes like thousands of other settlements across the lands jagan was built around a shard of the heart of the world,1

B07FTJ5XP2,corporate leadership audience i had lectured at grand rounds and hospitals and done many behavioral health talks but the difference between those experiences and even just standing in that green room was palpable i was trying to find a place to set up camp in a room with twenty other speakers each of us waiting to be called to do our ted style twenty minute talk at this day long event when that lonely feeling of not belonging and being at a place started washing over me i first checked if it was a gender thing because to date i'm often still the only female speaker backstage but that wasn't it it wasn't homesickness because i was thirty minutes from my house in houston when i heard the event organizers talking to the audience i pulled back a small section of the heavy velvet curtains that separated the green room from the auditorium and peaked out it was like a brooks brothers convention rows of mostly men in white shirts and very dark suits i shut the curtain and started to panic the guy standing close to me was a young super energetic speaker who you could tell had never met a stranger i'm not even sure what he was saying to me when i cut him off in mid sentence oh my god these are all business people like executives or f b i agents he he chuckled yeah mate it's a conference for sea levels did they tell you that the blood drained out of my face as i slowly sat down on the empty chair next to me he explained you know ceo c o o c f o's cmos ch aros all i could think was there is no way i'm going to tell this guy the truth he knelt next to me and put his arm on my shoulder you okay mate maybe it was the australian accent or the big smile or the name pete that made the sky instantly trustworthy but i turned to him and said they did tell me it was a sea level audience but i thought that meant down to earth like these are real sea level people salt of the earth like sea level s e a level through a huge booming laugh he said oh that's brilliant you should use that man i looked at him in the eye and said it's not funny i'm talking about shane and the danger of not believing were enough there was a long pause before i added ironically by that time a woman from washington d c who was doing her twenty minute talk on the oil trade was standing beside us she looked at me and said shame as in the emotion like i'm ashamed before i could even admitted that was true she said interesting better you than me and walked off i'll never forget pete's response look out into that audience again these are people just people and no one talks to them about shame and every single one of them is in it up to their eyeballs just like the rest of us look at them they're people i think he knew the truth of his advice or the thought of my topic got to him because he stood up squeezed my shoulder and walked away i quickly pulled out my laptop and searched popular m b a in business terms i was thinking maybe i can put some hard corners on my topic by weaving in a little business lingo damn it was like reading old hat new hat the berenstain bears book that my kids loved when they were little it's the story of papa bear going to the hat store and trying on fifty different hats to replace his old raggedy hat but of course all of the new hats have issues too loose too tight too heavy to light it goes on for pages until it reaches the law magical conclusion of keeping the old ugly hat that fits perfectly i started whispering some of the terms to myself to see if i could pull it off long pull item now to tall critical pathway no to traffic he skip level now to hopscotch he incentive maybe incentivize oh wait what i call bullshit he can't just add eyes to stuff mercifully my husband steve called and interrupted my berenstain bears business search how are you are you ready he asked no it's a total cluster i said after i explained the situation he was very quiet using his serious voice the one reserved for panicked parents calling for medical advice because he's a pediatrician or for me when i'm losing my mind he said rene promise me that you will not use any of those dumb ass words i mean it i was near tears at this point i whispered i promise but you should see these people steve it's like a funeral and not a,0

B007RYWYMO,no more than a three or four word affirmative everyone was agreed about this that one on both sides said it was like watching a tiger creeping stealthily along a branch moving nearer and nearer to the spot where it might pounce most tellingly upon it's prey yet there was no sense of dramatic movement when that moment came the lawyer glanced down at his notes as if preparing himself for one more routine query then he said in a voice of slightly puzzled reason chief superintendent lambert you obtained a search warrant and then proceeded to ransack my clients' home from where you stand now do you now consider this action an overreaction no the law protects members of the public against overreaction search warrants are not issued without due examination of the issues involved a shrug of the shoulders a slight shake of the head beneath the white curls of the wig and amused professional smile which council hoped took in the judge as well as his supporters you need not remind us here of what the law dictates chief superintendent he ruffled his papers then looked at lambert law like an adult disappointed by a child who has behaved badly would you not agree that your team exercised excessive force and vigor in the way they conducted the search no routine procedures were applied the search was thorough and methodical as the circumstances demanded it should be thorough and methodical the offending council dwelt on each syllable elongating the phrase to give it irony then as though he were forced to raise an unpleasant matter against his will he wouldn't attach any importance to the fact that mister murray's wife and daughters what terrified by the actions of your officers lambert paused in his turn looking completely calm but struggling to shut out the murmur of excitement in the court and to find the words for a measured reputation a degree of distress is inevitable in these situations i would dispute the word terrified i should also like the got to be aware that the daughters you have chosen dimension are aged nineteen and twenty three hardly the fearful infants your question implied i think the court will be aware that i suggested no such thing i should be obliged if you will confine yourself to factual answers to my questions chief superintendent lambert was too experienced to point out that his answer had been entirely factual they gave the man no reaction at all but merely stood mute and upright awaiting further questions it had the desired effect the lawyer studied him for a moment then said would you not concede that you're prolonged and aggressive attention to my client over several weeks was excessive did it not in fact amount to police harrassment the well worn even threadbare accusation the word harrassment came from prisoners when you had them defeated in the interview room when it came from a lawyer you knew that he was desperate trying to abandon his attack without losing too much face lambert permitted himself a small mirthless smile there was no harrassment involved we conducted a methodical investigation and we observe the correct protocol we did no more and no less than our duty to the public demanded the lawyer nodded avoiding lambert the patronizing smile which acknowledged in the arcane rites of the english law that the witness had successfully defended his position he kept any disappointment out of his voice as he said briskly no further questions lambert in his turn was careful to show no sign of relief and to leave the witness stand with measured step for him the strange little game was over though the case would go on for many days yet his mood was not improved when he returned to the police station at old trafford his partner in anti crime detective sergeant bert hook was waiting for him to lead the interrogation of a drug dealer who had been arrested over the weekend important certainly but not likely to bring any spectacular success pay people like alfie turner were arrested every week but they were small fish swimming in a large and murky pond the killer sharks who controlled this evil lucrative industry was shadowy monsters often,0

B008N1TY8M,the birds would return even though they could see the cat it's lack of motion reassured them convinced them that they were safe the cat never reacted to those first birds the cat would wait and watch and eventually they'd become so confident in their safety that one would come just near enough and then there would be a blinding strike and those around the victim would scatter give them enough time though then they would return always because the feeder was there the feeder was home and though they might be capable of remembering what had befallen one of their own in the same spot they did not believe it could happen to them as well unshakable confidence unshakable stupidity he is fascinated by the confident specimens of the helpless he finds no fascination in the fearful the first bird took him longer than it took the cat but not as long as he'd expected the secret was in his stillness the secret was in their stupidity it took him only five days to get the cardinal he killed the cat when that was done there was nothing more to be learned from it he has patients for study and hunger for it in the way that only those truly devoted to a craft can ever possess his craft is killing his understanding of it is great but he knows there will always be more to learn and in that knowledge is his happiness he has studied the behavior of killers has spoken with them has lived behind steel bars with them and he has learned from them all now as the wind freshens and the smell of dead leaves fills air that is rapidly chilling with the promise of rain he stares at the front of the high school long enough to observe the security guard in the parking lot and then he walks down the block and turns the corner and the football field comes into view here the cardinals make their claim to glory it's a terrible name for sporting teams why not the warriors or titans or tigers how does one summon any level of confidence wearing the logo of a bird that can be killed by the squeeze of a child's palm there are half a dozen men sitting in the aluminum bleachers that border the field he is not the only watcher today they are undefeated these cardinals they are the most intense pride of a town that once had many more reasons to be proud he slips in leans beside the bleachers with hands in pockets and waits for the coach to arrive the coach of course is more than a coach he has won one hundred fifty three games for this school this community he has lost only twenty two on this field where his players are now stretching limbering up against the wind and beneath the gray sky he has a record of eighty one wins against four losses just four home losses he's more than a coach he is a folk hero a mythic figure and not just because of the winds oh no coach kent austin is about much more than football he proves it now drawing silence as he walks across the field still a young man and a fit one but always with the trace of a limp the left knee refusing to match strides with the right one always yielding just a little more a little too much it only adds to the coaches compelling quality everyone else recognizes his wounds the coach pretends not to it is not only the young players in uniform who fall silent as the coach makes his way across the field it is the men in the stands the watchers there is a reverence about them now because what happens on this field matters deeply to people who have not so much as walked across it's surface you take your pride where you can find it and right now this is where it can be found because hard times have come to chambers this much he understands well reads it as a weather forecaster would read the dark clouds scudding in off lake erie he is a forecaster in his own right a prophet a have hard times the coach is far too focused to look up and see him because the coach is at work lost to the game that he insists does not matter but of course it matters because it is all he really has in the end empty games and empty,0
B00G3DH93O,on horseback the sacred overlook was barely an hour away it would be necessary to cross ghost wolf mesa on nabi formation dotted with kiva and pit house ruins a dozen winters had passed since he had ventured near that silent sinister place where old bones molded under a lichen and ck crusted rubble mud there was no other way to approach the crag a narrow precipitous causeway of crumbling sandstone connected the mesa rim to that appraised wedge-shaped platform where the old ones had built a splendid temple to honor the goddess of the moon during his last visit santos had stood on the very tip of the stone triangle contemplating the gigantic sons of white shell woman while he'd stared at the twins something outlandish had happened he had found himself leaning heavily on one leg then the other as if a trillion tons of sandstone pitched and swayed under his feet the startled pilgrim had been overwhelmed by the illusion that he was on the deck of an enormous storm tossed ship it seemed the illusory vessel was under full sail towards some dark alien harbor but that had been years ago he sat in the saddle squinting at the distant mesa that dark haunted space that must be crossed to approach the sacred platform and the utes lurid imagination the lumpy sandstone formation was a massive hand reaching up from lower world with all fingers folded except one that long crooked digit pointed suggestively toward the twins and on this morning it beckoned to the lone horseman to to ward off this enticement santos closed his eyes in doing so he encountered the inner darkness and looked to deeply the old vision enveloped him he is on the crag standing on the very tip of the soaring bow santos gazes over interlocked waves of space and time a splendid illusion grips his mind just ahead separated by the nearest slice of sky the towering giant stand shoulder to shoulder knee deep in petrified tell us dunes they are anchored to the depths of a ghostly sea waiting for their mother's pale face to appear between them these are the slayers of monsters ready to take on sinew and muscle over bones of stone and as in the beginning of days slay those unspeakable monsters that feed on human flesh esh,0

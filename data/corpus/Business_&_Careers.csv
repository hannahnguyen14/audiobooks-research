B01N7J3RQ6,country given that business and india has tended to look westwards when it comes to case studies involving brands indeed there is greater familiarity among indian practitioners with brands like apple microsoft nike dove and virgin then with local success stories this audiobook is a treasure trove of stories about indian brands that have succeeded in the face of great challenges like all good stories they carry nuggets of wisdom and learning and like the truly great stories they sometimes leave the extraction of this learning to the reader covering a diverse range of categories and contexts they are designed to stimulate thought and promote reflection the learning lies and stories of both similarity and difference in some cases readers will find situations that are analogous to the ones they encounter while in others they will find ideas that help imac legend their own context very differently under the able handling of venetia more advani who is both an experienced marketer and an engaged thinker the book that you're about to listen to will make it easy to learn from the experience of successful brands more importantly it will open new doors in your mind santos this i introduction as human beings we are born to be curious we are wired to search for knowledge ideas and patterns and see how we can use them to better our own world and the world of those around us as someone passionate about consumer insights and behavior i was always intrigued by companies that managed to create strong consumer connections by thinking ahead of their time by not following the beaten but as i grew in my career so did the urge to find out what went on behind the scenes in these organizations this book is an outcome of harnessing my long ge journey of curiosity to create a reservoir of success stories that can benefit others who are equally hungry for knowledge the idea for the book began with a simple thought in a diverse challenging and often unpredictable market like india a handful of companies are doing an excellent job of attracting consume dumas and meeting their needs as well as creating business value for themselves digging deeper i realized that most of these companies have done something out of the ordinary and in the process they have stormed and shaken up the market transforming stale categories into vibrant ones some of the these are also companies talked about in the media but most often the details are sketchy and sporadic a marketing campaign here a quote from a senior official there or sometimes an interview with the head of the company to seemingly get a preview of what's cooking inside but what emerges most often is snapshot of their market performance or the new launches that are on the way the whole gamut of thinking and work that is feeding their success engine is seldom examined what challenges they faced what internal and external obstacles became stumbling blocks what decisions were made at key junctures and what the execution roadmap that paved the way for actual performance was it is out of the need to address these very gaps that this book has emerged i felt that if the wisdom of this handful of companies could be made available to a wider public it would help many more people in turn become winners in their own spheres the stories in this book belonged to leading businesses and the people will that run them on the face of it we already recognize them as markers of success in their categories however my real interest lay in uncovering the strategies that have been undertaken to help them achieve continuous success what did they do that was against the expected how did they storm the norm to cry create fresh new categories or business models or change consumer habits permanently and did they do that right from the word go or did they have to sweat it out to become the powerful influences they are today interestingly while going through the chosen businesses along with ranjan mallik an innovation specialist i discovered that it is possible to put a method on how to learn from these brands how one can actually storm the norm we have synthesised this in the form of a framework which you can find in the afterward you could go through it after you have read some or all the stories and feel free to use it as a template to storm the norm and succeed in your next big challenge,1
B00IPNN1XW,a lifetime is embedded it does not float free it is tethered to certain decades to places to people it has a context each departure leaves a person shaped void the absence within a family the presence lost within a house in a community in society itself we go but hanging for awhile in other people's heads something we said something we did we leave a ghostly imprint on our backdrop very few people go one further and are distilled into a blue plaque on a building i began on a spring morning in the anglo american hospital in zamalek which was a residential suburb on jazeera the island in cairo's nile seventeenth of march nineteen thirty three elsewhere things were going on that would lead to turmoil in north africa in a few years' time my parents' lives would be affected and mine but they were comfortably oblivious that morning and i was tucked up in a crib the feet of which stood in tin trays of water because they had been instances of ants getting newborn babies towards the end of my own stint i find myself thinking less about what has happened to me but interested in this lifetime context in the times of my life i have the great sustaining ballast of memory we will do and hope to hang onto it i'm interested in the way that memory works in what we do with it and what it does with us and when i look around my cluttered house more ballast material ballast i can see myself oddly identified and defined by what is in it my life charted out on the bookshelves my concerns illuminated by range of objects these then are the prompts for this book age memory time and this curious physical evidence i find all around me as to what i've been up to how reading has fed into writing how ways of thinking have been nailed the can be a certain detachment about it the solipsism of writing about oneself tempered by the more compelling interest of general concerns what it means to be old but the long view does to us or for us how we mutate with our times but a report from the front line has to be just that this is my old age so i have to get personal as well as consider the wider implications of where i am now which is something i've not done before like i think most people have not paid too much attention to old age to individuals yes family friends but the status has not been on my radar gave up my seat on the bus of course feign polite attention to some rambling anecdote raise my voice repeat myself with patients avoid occasionally i fear that hazard light worn by the old slow potentially boring howard going now that i wear the light myself i'm nicely aware of the status this is a different place and since i am there along with plenty of my friends the expedient thing seems to be to examine it and report we are many today in the western world the new demographic i want to look at the implications of that at the condition that how it has been perceived and then at the compelling matter of memory the vapor trail without which we are undone and my own context the context of anyone my age the accompanying roar of the historical process i want to remember what those events felt like at the time those by which i felt most fingered the suez crisis the cold war the seismic change in attitudes of the late twentieth century and see how they are judged today with the wisdoms of historical hindsight and finally some pure solipsism one person's life as reflected by possessions books and a selection of things mine but a story that anyone could tell most of his fetch up with an identifying code,0

B00C3GZ8Y2,nowhere we chatted for awhile all i wanted to do was to leave this refrigerator room as soon as possible even the sticky heat outside will be preferable to freezing in my own perspiration i made to leave thank you for coming don't call us we'll call you said from both sides with polite hotelier sincerity and with smiles all round as i was leaving the room i casually mention that i would love to go to later as i had seen a brochure for the lhasa hotel outside her office from that moment my fate was sealed yo mean you'll want to walk in lhasa was the incredulous response to my passing remark the door was closed behind me and before i had turned round my interview was on the phone to the company's vice president i had to face him that day as the next morning i would be returning to my job in paris still wondering what i had let myself in for i entered his office and elegant apartment decorated with immense scrolls of chinese calligraphy some of the scrolls had merely a few characters messily swiped over the rice paper with a large brush it looked to me like the scribbling of a child let loose with a pot of black poster paint my host appreciating my observation of the calligraphy pointed out the red chops on each scroll that showed we were looking at works of art from great chinese masters from the chinese writing he read the names out to me and i nodded in admiration of these masterpieces wondering how much one got paid for producing these things and whether my little nieces could be millionaires before the age of ten the vice presidents swiveled pensively on his chair a sumptuous black leather swivel chair from which he made decisions every day concerning the multi million dollar chinese empire of holiday inn this was the person who would decide the future direction of my career broad shoulders a large square face with a mop of gray hair and thin wire framed spectacles added to his somber and learned appearance he nodded for me to sit down and then proceeded to scrutinize me in detail the intensity of his look and wry smile on his face were unnerving and not quite knowing where to look my eyes darted from his face too the scrolls on the wall to the spectacular view of hong kong from his window crimson and silver taxes edged along the congested streets far below us in a world which was miles away it is strange to see the world from above somehow it is a private place which humans were never meant to see like the kitchens of a restaurant or the bathrooms of royalty far below perspiring heads glimmered in the sunlight litter and fallen laundry covered every ledge and portico beneath the high rise daylight betrayed the rusting brackets of the neon street signs which crept even this high up the skyscrapers unsightly air conditioning units jutted out of the exterior a walls spewing annoying little drops of water onto the hapless pedestrians far below this last thought on the air conditioning brought my mind back to the present i was decidedly uncomfortable my had still not dried out and the vice president's gray eyes enlarged by the thick glass of his bifocals continue to stare at me penetrating my inner thoughts after several minutes of silence he tilted back in his chair and spoke with a deep slow authoritative voice so young man you are going to be sales and marketing manager you are going to spend six months a year into bed with the axe and six months a year screwing your brain turns out in hong kong how does that sound to you startled by his own question he jumped suddenly from his chair and nervously asked me not to repeat what he had just said trying to regain his composure he sank uneasily back into his swivel chair and gave me some advice on survival in china he had worked there for many years and was reputed to know the system better in any one be careful he said it is not like the western world he paused when you see a local girl just remember this one proverb you can't try the shirt on before you buy it not really certain what he was on about i nodded in agreement they will be watching you he continued remember even when you break wind they will know it be careful with these last words fixed in my mind and still wondering why i should be buying shirts with local girls i returned to paris to hand in my notice,0

B01CYKTYNW,our technologies are racing ahead but many of our skills and organizations are lagging behind for many workers this lag predicts bad news as intelligent machines improve and the gap between machine and human abilities shrinks employers are becoming increase tingly likely to hire new machines instead of new people and when only a human will do improvements in communications and collaboration technology are making remote work easier than ever before motivating companies to outsource key roles to stars leaving the local tech talent pool underemployed this reality is not however universally grim as brynjolfsson and mcafee emphasize this great restructuring is not driving down all jobs but is instead dividing them though an increasing number of people will lose lose in this new economy as their skills become automatable or easily outsourced there are others who will not only survive but thrive becoming more valued and therefore more rewarded than before brynjolfsson and mcafee aren't alone in proposing this by model trajectory for the economy in two thousand and thirteen for example the george mason economist tyler cowen published average is over a book that echoes this thesis of a digital division but what makes brynjolfsson and mcafee's analysis particularly useful is that they proceed to identify three specific group ps that will fall on the lucrative side of this divide and reap a disproportionate amount of the benefits of the intelligent machine age not surprisingly it's to these three groups that silver hanson and door happened to belong let's touch on each of these groups in turn to better understood and why there is suddenly so valuable the high skilled workers brynjolfsson and mcafee call the group personified by nate silver the high skilled workers advances such as robotics and voice recognition are automating many low skilled positions but as these economists emphasize other technologies like data visualization analytics high speed kim indications and rapid prototyping have augmented the contributions of more abstract and data driven reasoning increasing the values of these jobs in other words those with the oracular ability to work with and tease valuable results out of increasingly complex machines will thrive tyler cowen summarizes this reality more bluntly the key question will be are you good at working with intelligent machines or not nate silver of course with his comfort in feeding data into large databases then siphoning it out into his mysterious monte carlo simulations is the epitome of the high skilled worker intelligent machines are not an obstacle to silver success but instead provide it's precondition the superstars the ace programmer david heiner my r hanson provides an example of the second group that brynjolfsson and mcafee predict will thrive in our new economy superstars high speed data networks and collaboration tools like email and virtual meeting software have destroyed regionalism in many sectors of knowledge work it no longer makes sense for example to hire a full time programmer put aside office space and pay benefits when you can instead pay one of the the world's best programmers like hansen for just enough time to complete the project at hand in this scenario you'll probably get a better result for less money while hansen can service many more clients per year and will therefore also end up better off the fact that hanson might be working remotely from marbella spain while your office is in des moines iowa doesn't matter to your company as advances in communication and collaboration technology make the process near seamless this reality does matter however to the less skilled local programmers living in des moines and in need of a steady paycheck this same trend holds for the growing number of fields where technology makes productive remote work possible consulting marketing writing design and so on once the talent market is made universally accessible those at the peak of the market thrive while the rest suffer,1
1400222842,id have godly counsel saul received his from samuel and david from samuel and later nathan the prophet but look at how different their rains were as monarchs saul never really understood the nature of leadership the day he was appointed king he actually hid from the people i believe he did that because he he recognized his inability to lead but after he tasted success in battle he mistook his position as king for real leadership though he had the title power and crown of a king he never moved the monarchy beyond a charisma based judgeship he was made a general but he never attract a large standing army he created no organized government to preserve his gains and when god no longer favoured him he thought the title of king entitled him to continue leading david on the other hand seized opportunities to grow in his leadership he learned to be a warrior he built a standing army and conquered his enemies he chose the city and captured it to become the nation's new capital and then he built a lasting government there much of that he did before he sat on the throne from the beginning all the people of israel and judah loved him first samuel chapter eighteen verse sixteen david attack active citizens warriors and leaders alike and he led them well as the result of his leadership the people flourished to both faced great challenges every leader faces obstacles tests and trials sollen david sometimes faced the same ones take ally as for example when the huge philistine offered to fight israel's champion both saul and david heard the warriors challenge saul israel's greatest warrior who rightfully should have faced the giant in battle reacted by hiding in fear but david a mere boy was eager to face the challenge and win on enter for god what was saul's reaction he offered david his armor why not saul wasn't going to be using it while others wait to see what's going to happen leaders step forward and rise to a challenge three both had the choice to change and grow the two mins very different reactions when confronted with their shortcomings capture the two natures of saul and david when saul disobedient lee made a burnt offering to god samuel rebuked him the scripture is silent on what followed there is no record of sorrow or repentance by saul instead the narrative continues with sol's campaign against the philistines evidently he kept going on the same course david's reaction to his in on the other hand was remarkably different after david committed adultery with bathsheba and sent her husband to his death nathan confronted him and the king sorrowfully repented the one who lifted the lid david's interaction with nathan is representative of his attitude during his life he was never afraid to admit his shortcomings ask god for forgiveness and blessing and improve himself it is the reason the lid on his leadership kept getting lifted higher and higher we can all learn from david if we want to reach our potential and become the person god would have is to be then we need to lift the lids on our lives that's the only way we can go to the next level today's question for reflection in your leadership have you been more like david or saw day two leadership thought for the day every leader has lids samuel said to saul you have done foolishly you have not kept the commandment of the lord your god which he commanded you for now the lord would have established your kingdom over israel forever but now your kingdom shall not continue first samuel chapter thirteen verses thirteen and fourteen every leader has lids on his life nobody is born without them and they don't disappear when a person receives a title achieves a position or is invested with power the issue is never whether you have lids the issue is what you are going to do about them the lids that limited saul when god made saul king of israel he removed all the external lids from the new rulers life saul received god's anointing he took the position of king and had the potential to become a great leader but even though he had no external lids to his leadership there still remained internal lids in seoul there were many fear he began his reign by hiding among the equipment and he was afraid to face goliath if impatience,1

B00769VW8M,you get it order an importance in the buyer's mind are more vital than being first to market there's also a big difference between being first and third on a google search as evidenced by companies like first place intel and second place advanced micro as of december two thousand and nine for example intel had earned that thirty two billion dollars in revenue and it's second place oh by the way it had thirteen billion in cash second place advanced micro head four point nine billion dollars in revenues and two and a half billion dollars in cash was the point look the difference between first and second okay was six times amount of cash and what about barack obama and john mccain in that last election only a few points separated the names that many people will forget from someone who has made history again brock was not first to the market he actually came thirty years after mccain and had much less experience yet he managed to win not just the number one spot but the most powerful position in the world at least at that time so look quit compromising quit being reasonable let's get you fighting every minute of every day for the number one spot in your business you want to be top when the market is great and take market share when it's not great and keep this in mind when i'm talking about first i'm not talking about finished in a race first i'm talking about dominating the buyers mind your prospect or your buyer's mind dominating their mind so that your first in their mind when they think about your product game changing economy business people sales people managers entrepreneurs and ceos fear economic reductions contraction it's an understandably so they reasoned correctly that when the economy moves into a period of major contraction like we're experiencing and still experiencing clients and customers cut back on projects reduce their spending and worse sacrifice quality looking for lowest price vendors and our lowest price suppliers it becomes more difficult at this time to raise capital close transactions and make accurate projections affecting planning at all levels these game changing economic times can occasionally require major transitions in your skill set as well particularly following periods of extended expansion like we you know have experienced over the last ten or twelve years it's not uncommon that management team sales forces an employees won't be properly equipped to transition in these game changing economies it's fairly easy to observe people's motivation and skill sets are crippled from extended periods of economic expansion it's like a professional fighter who after a series of easy bouts appears to lose his edge his power even his sense of the basics people tend to become dependent after periods of expansion on surplus of opportunities prospect easy credit cheap money and develop this overall goldilocks if you will attitude on finding things that are just right when the market changes and belts tighten every single one of your company's weaknesses your personal weaknesses your process weaknesses your management team weaknesses even individual members and their weaknesses become magnified you get it when things get tight and tough dude all all your weaknesses get magnified in the marketplace mistakes become more costly failures become a real pain possibility for both individuals and companies who are not able to transition into the new smaller tighter tougher economy at the time that i begin writing if you're not first you're last the world was entering one of the greatest economic contraction since the great depression look isn't funny the great recession is serious it's deep it's ugly it has created more unemployment in the united states than any other recession since the twenties during periods of major major game changing economic shifts people immediately find themselves scared confused overwhelmed angry unsure and and hopeless about what to do and whether or not there's anything they can do during times like these people suddenly realize that their businesses incomes and their futures are at risk it abruptly seems as though the world is amelie giving each of us a giant wake-up call by screaming you're vulnerable and may cease to exist the truth of the matter is that if you aren't number one in your category or feel then you're in a precarious and dangerous situation look we got forty two million people on food stamps in this country we have unemployment numbers that are sixteen to twenty five million people unemployed or underemployed we have homeless,1
B00D6ORC62,the problem of the received historical image of henry the eighth for it's an image that has shaped the very way in which we approach his reign intellectually though he lived five centuries before our own the image of henry has become a virtual icon of our own popular culture he's still the only king of england i think whose portrait most people including perhaps most americans would recognize on sight and that is itself an important aspect of his reign that fact it tells us that henry was england's first renaissance prince and he employed one of the great artists of the renaissance hans holbein the younger to fashion lasting images of his self inflated authority these were powerful pieces of royal propaganda there are two images indisputable eli holbein at one you see a reproduction of it on the wall behind me a facial portrait or half length portrait of fifteen thirty six and the other in the national portrait gallery in london is really a full length preparatory drawing for a now lost mural that holbein painted and fifteen thirty seven for his principal london palace at whitehall in that painting or that cartoon i should say we see the standing figure of henry the end it really is i think for many people the now stereotypical image of him a bejeweled richly clothed king ing striking an aggressive in-your-face proud bold legged stance for this reason one forgets how innovative it was in fifteen thirty seven it was meant to be seen from a point below the top of one's head on the wall of the privy chamber at whitehall and holbein deliberately distorted the king's figures the arms and legs are not anatomically correctly attached to the body it was meant to all to inspire to strike fear in the viewer it's a contrived pose what's become part of the theatre of tudor majesty to borrow one historian's phrase well influential tudor writers reinforced and magnify fide that image of henry's power one of them for example was edward hall a cambridge educated lawyer a london city official a member of parliament hall witnessed some of the great events of the day and his enthralling detailed chronicle published at mid century in the reign of henry son the sixth trumpeted the virtues of what hall called henry's triumphant policies later in the century and the elizabethan period the chronicler raphael hollen shed echoed hall's theme continuing this new tradition of historical writing some of you may know that shakespeare used the second edition of hall's chronicle the addition of fifteen eighty seven for many of his history plays well if you were to read holland should either edition the first or the second you would discover how stylistically wooden it is it's also derivative but never mind for his play king henry the eighth first performed in sixteen thirteen henry used pollen ceds edition of fifteen eighty seven now in the seventeenth eighteenth nineteenth and twentieth centuries popular dramatic productions of shakespeare's play king henry the eighth amplified these tudor perceptions of a spectacular king and his court the productions of the mid-nineteenth century were especially interesting and lavish for example the producer charles keene nineteen fifty five he laid on an establishing production of henry the eighth it ran for one hundred consecutive nights which was a record breaker at the time the play lends itself to processions ceremony any spectacle and keen in cecil b demille fashioned pulled out all the stops it was lavish it was extravagant of panoramas to blows the emphasis again on spectacle well in the last half of the twentieth century televised versions or filmed visions of henry the eighth by se royal shakespeare company or bbc television productions of the play they have also spread shakespeare's vision to a mass audience interestingly the popularity of the plato in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries also stimulated artists to reimagine certain scenes in the play pictorially for example john boydell in london in seventeen eighty nine actually founded an art gallery the shakespeare guy,0

B0047V9EFA,within days of lincoln's assassination on april fourteenth eighteen sixty five a boston photographer published a fantastical carter visit image to honor the fallen president that was not unusual printers photographers and stationers across the country produced hundreds of thousands if not millions of ribbons badges broadsides poems and photographs to mourn lincoln but the image from boston was different for it expressed a sentiment not of mourning but a vengeance in this cart to visit a stern faced woman crowned and draped as colombia accompanied by her servant a screaming eagle about to take flight in pursuit of it's prey keeps a vigil over a portrait of the martyred president and echoes john brown's old warning make a chain for the land is full of bloody crimes soon in the aftermath of the chase for jefferson davis and the lincoln assassination and death pageant manacles and chains became symbols of the spring of eighteen sixty five northerners believe that jefferson davis and the confederacy had committed many bloody crimes including the assassination of abraham lincoln the torture starvation and murder of union prisoners of war and the battlefield slaughter of soldiers in the south lincoln and his armies were seen as perpetrators not victims of great crime rhymes in the climate of these dueling accusations the people of the union and the confederacy both shared a common belief and could agree upon one thing in the spring of eighteen sixty five an era of bloody crimes had reached it's climax the spring of eighteen sixty five was the most remarkable season in american history it was a time to more in the civil wars six hundred and twenty thousand dead and to bind up the nation's wounds it was a time to lay down arms to tally plantations and cities that had been laid to waste and to plant new crops in was a time to ponder events that had come to pass and to look forward to those yet to be it was the time of the hunt for jefferson davis and of the funeral pageant for abraham lincoln each a martyr to his cause and it was the time in america wrote walt whitman when lilacs last asked in the door yard bloomed prologue washington d c if you go there today and walk to the most desolate corner of the cemetery and then descend the half hidden decaying black slate steps past all the other graves down toward rock creek and the trees you will find the tomb now long empty no sign remain means that he was ever here his name was never chiseled into the stone arch above the entry but here during the civil war in the winter of eighteen sixty two eleven year old willie lincoln his father's best beloved son was laid to rest here his ever morning father returned to visit him to remember and to weep and here the boy waited patiently behind the iron gates locked inside the marble vault that looked no bigger than a child's playhouse for his father to claim him and carry him home that appointment like his tie the coffin was set in stone march fourth eighteen sixty nine the day abraham lincoln would complete his second term as president of the united states leave washington and undertake the long railroad journey west to illinois but in the spring of eighteen sixty five in the first week of april that homecoming seemed a long way off president lincoln still had so much more to do richmond virginia if you visit his home today you will find no sign that he ever left the exterior of the house looks almost exactly like it does in the civil war era photographs in his private office documents still lie on his desk as if awaiting his signature his presidential oil portrait hangs on a wall maps chart the once mighty territorial expanse of the antebellum south's proud agricultural empire books line the shelves children's toys lie scattered across the floor the house is furnished as it was april second eighteen sixty five the day he last walked out the door never to return in the spring of eighteen sixty five in the first week of april he also had much to do the future was uncertain his capital city could no longer be defended and my fall to invading union armies within days even hours to save his country he had,0
B07T91W5BN,in a normal tone was an effort it made every inch of me alive and aware of him closing my eyes heightened my other senses he moved closer and his bare forearm brushed against mine the hair on my arms and neck raised visualize it happening oh i was visualizing something happening focus on the feel of it the feather against your hat hand the cool of the metal my entire body buzz as i focus and set on the tickle of hanks arm against mine i struggled to inhale in a normal way every breath scented with his cinnamon and sugar smell he was always sneaking down to the bakery to work alongside us when he could pull it to you pull the energy to do it for others it comes from then for a swallows we have to feel for an outside source who could be the energy of these books or the flames of the candles something that makes you feel full of energy with my eyes closed i couldn't see the energy of these things exactly but something shifted in the same way i knew where he stood i thought he could sense the location of the candle flames maybe i was imagining it the sensation felt so new and strange it pulled my attention away from the handsome prince behind me i emptied my mind of everything but the energy of the closest candle flame the sheep grew clearer in my mind i could picture the long teardrop shape burning clean and steady but how to draw the energy to me as if reading my mind hanks spoke oak think of it like eating you taken food as fuel to power yourself some foods make better fuel than others some are more pleasurable to eat decide what fill you want to take in and just as hard to explain but you swallow it i kept my eyes closed but smiled hank your words are helping but i think i might need you to back up a bit your little distracting an understatement he cleared his throat sorry he stepped away his shoes clipping away on the tiled floor the cool of the air around me helped to clear my head i sought out the candle again and found it more easily this time i visualized eating it and a warm glow grew in my chest but it didn't seem enough i'd need to pull more energy one by one i sought out each of the two dozen candles in the room visualizing them in my mind the tingles came back this time from the excitement of magic i'd never been able to feel sources of power like this i kept my attention focused in front of me i knew if i cast my mind behind me i'd find a very potent source of energy but not the kind i needed for lifting the quill holding all the right candles in the darkness of my mind i took a deep breath filling my lungs but also inhaling energetically i pulled in the energy of the candles a wind blew tendrils of hair across my collarbones and rustled my bangs he danced up and down my arms and legs similar to the heat hank inspired this crackled and dan it's through my veins itching to be released i reached up both hands and found the quill in my mind as hank had instructed i visualize the stiff but soft fibres of the cobalt blue feather in my hand i lifted my arms and imagined the quill lifting as well the wind picks up hank gasped imagine chapter two great power i opened my eyes and lurched backward pressing my hands to my mouth for another split second twenty books hung suspended in the air the quill hovered below them and the massive wooden table floated above the ground icy fear replaced the heat my veins and items crashed to the ground the books falling on their open pages oh no i'm so sorry i rushed forward and knelt to gather them before their pages creased i clicked my tongue at myself too late hank rushed up and crouched next to me he snapped his fingers and the dozens of candles i'd extinguished roulette themselves i didn't look up but kept fussing with the books stacking them in my arms i ruined them he lifted his palms and touched the books till i handed them over to him he set them aside then he took both of my hands in his large warm once i lowered my eyes imagine hey i sighed and looked at him he dipped his head and held my gaze his bows lifted in the middle and his mouth twitched toward a smile oh that was amazing i ducked my head again and stared at the colourful mosaic tiles on the floor what's wrong embarrassment burned at my chest i lifted my eyes to his face i don't know i just freaked out i guess he pulled his lips to the side never breaking eye contact with me i get that like every time you allow allow yourself to go there and access your magic you panic and shut it down because you're afraid it's going to get out of hand how did he always say the right thing i nodded his throat bobbed that's how i felt when i first started my lessons well shouldn't i be scared i frowned it's like when i first learned to drive i couldn't wait to but then once i got behind the wheel and realized my adopted dad expected me to drive the thing unreal streets with other people around i was like are you crazy i shouldn't be allowed to do this i have no idea what i'm doing i feel the same way now like what if i get out of control and pull energy from someone without meaning to and they get hurt or worse or the smoke,0
B07SF9WYDT,people often ask if entrepreneurs are born or made i never know which camp i fall into no one else in my family run their own business but if you grew up in a rough part of east london like i did you quickly learned the people who do well for themselves don't work for anyone else my mum was a carer for the elderly and my dad was in demolition they both worked incredibly hard real physical labor but money was always tight somehow though my mom always managed to find a way of making sure we didn't go without there was just enough money for a few treats but the the money and the treats were rationed i remember when my dad broke my bike in a fit of anger my mum paid for a new one two pounds a week on tick at a local shop at the end of our street was a cafe owned by rita the mother of my mom's best friend she also owned the local sweet shop and the nearest laundrette i don't remember anyone ever calling rita an entrepreneur but that's exactly what she was no one talked about role models back then either but she was that two when my school results became so bad the teachers gave up on me at the back of my mind i thought i'll be like rita and start a business of my own i left school at sixteen without a single qualification and started a window cleaning round within a few months i had a handful of people working for me soon after i sold the business for six thousand pounds and started a car sales yard neither were big businesses but i learned a lot about things like cust macaire and managing cash probably the most important thing i picked up from those businesses was a belief that i would always be able to make money coming from a background like mine where everyone apart from rita lived payday to payday those initial unsexy businesses gave me confidence and i started believing one day i'd be able to run a bigger business it was only a matter of finding the right idea,1
B01AX7RW1O,no thicker than most chief reporter with regional daily in the midlands life was good unbelievably good besides the job which i enjoyed i was a happily married man with a lovely wife and a beautiful little daughter and then it all fell apart sometimes when i'm looking at life through the bottom of a whiskey tumbler it seems to me that things started to go wrong with the stanford case though of course that had nothing whatever to do with the decimation of my private life it somehow marks the boundary between then and now fraser's stamford was a prominent local councillor chair of god knows how many committees trustee of this and that on the board of governors of several schools he'd been invited to garden party at buckingham palace and awarded an o b e his beneficence face and portly stomach regular use grace the pages of the advertiser a man most admired a pillar of the community and then i was told very quietly about the wads of money in brown envelopes that were changing hands wads of money that were finding their way into various bank accounts belonging to fraser's stamford in exchange for certain firms gaining lucrative council contracts naturally i went after the story and the deeper i dug the more mk i uncovered far from being the upright citizen he pretended to be fraser stamford was little more than a crook and the losers ultimately were the taxpayers who believed him to be something between a savior and a saint trouble was stamford had friends in high places some of them no doubt as corrupt as he was when i tried to run the story i was told in no uncertain terms to bury it i refused the people stanford represented deserve the truth i got my way the story aired and a police investigation ended up with stamford being sent to prison but my position on the paper was no longer tenable i wasn't sacked exactly but you could say i'd have had a case for constructive dismissal if i'd chosen to dig into a tribunal i went freelance the stanford case had attracted the attention of the nationals and i was able to make a good living stringing for them writing articles features and comment and when the chance arose getting my teeth into other exposes too bare my wife wasn't keen on the expos as them i must admit i got a buzz out of them she didn't like the subterfuge and she was nervous that one day i'd be attacked and have my own hidden camera or tape recorder broken over my skull what would i do if anything happened to you she used to say he had run off with one of your rich ex boyfriends and live a life of luxury i joke bev had the sort of looks that always made me wonder why she'd given me a second glance much less married me when she could have had a pick from practically every red blooded male who entered orbit but i want a life of luxury she'd say at least not with any of them i want you to don't you dare get yourself killed if you do i'll never forgive you and i'd kiss her and tell her i had no intention of allowing myself to be killed and neither of us had the faintest premonition that bev was the one who would die and i was the one who'd be left why would we who thinks in this day and age that having a child is going to kill a fit healthy young woman that's what happened though and all the more ironic since we were both so delighted when bev fell pregnant again daisy four years old at the time was delighted to at the prospect of a baby brother or sister though she was determined it would be a sister who she announced should be called cinderella cinderella was actually second choice for some unfathomable reason her first choice was calories truth to tell i have never quite been able to forgive myself for not spotting something was wrong though how i could be expected to know when the health professionals missed it i don't know i'd never even heard of preeclampsia but it's not a word i'm ever likely to forget now it's what killed bev and the little unborn cinderella cali breeze too suddenly i was a widower half crazy with grief and shock with the sole care of a four year old who couldn't understand where mummy had gone and why when she cried for her she didn't come back i don't know how we'd have got through it if it hadn't been for tom and judy bev's parents though they were in a hell of a state to have observed,0

B078TQV2DV,there's a saying that really sums up how to become successful in life one of my mentors is tony robbins i worked for him back in the late nineteen nineties and that experiences how i got started as a professional speaker coach and consultant his work impacted me so much that i still go to the events that he does here in the united states and work as a part of his support team tony popularized the quote from the late jim rohn success leaves clues now this was a key concept that led me to creating the framework behind the anatomy transformation the very first time you achieve anything whether you realize it or not a strategy for achieving that specific result has been created whether it's successfully tying your shoe for the first time succeeding at riding a bike closing a sale or successfully negotiating a business deal whether your car consciously aware of it or not a strategy or a recipe for achieving that result again has been created that means if you follow the strategy you follow the recipe you follow those steps in the exact order that led to the result you have the ability to achieve that result again and again and again does this make sense it's like having the recipe for an award with eating cake if you follow that recipe repeatedly you will consistently create not award winning cake primary principles defined when creating a framework that can be implemented as a system it's important to understand that there are parts of the system that are foundation of the framework these are called the primary principles these principles allow the framework to be used in different contexts as an example when building a vehicle there are some foundational elements that are found in all vehicles a frame a source of propulsion a source of energy a way to control direction a system for stopping and depending on the terrain a component to allow you to operate in that terrain doesn't matter if it's a bicycle a motorcycle a car a truck a boat or an airplane the primary principles that allow a mode of transportation to be created all exist at a fundamental level now based on your outcome based on what you're looking at transport and the terrain that you'll be traversing you'll then implement different strategies to achieve that outcome you may use an electric motor or a gasoline engine a diesel engine as your form of energy and propulsion but they all need read these primary components it's the same with the anatomy transformation whether you're looking to transform your health your relationships your finances your company the primary principles of transformation are the same the framework is consistent it's the strat geez that you will use within the framework that will vary another example will be mountain climbing you wouldn't use the same strategies to reach the top of the mountain if you were approaching it from the east side with a ninety foot vertical rock face as you would if you were approaching it from the west side where there was a thirty degree grade with hiking trails but you would use the same principles of knowing your outcome having a plan getting the right supplies etc that make sense quite simply when you understand the primary principles and how to implement the appropriate strategy these you'll be armed with all the information you need that will allow you to achieve transformation in every area of your life so let's start by taking a look at what i call the seven phases of transformation although you do progress from one phase to the next and they are sequential lol i do not call them steps for a very specific reason this will become more clear as we start talking about phase one one thing i want to be very clear about as we begin this journey is there are no shortcuts in this process the system is proven and it works every time but you must go through every phase in the sequence only by fully following the process as will you be able to create the level of transformation you desire and then be able to duplicate the process for yourself and also help others,1
B00W4DPRUO,there was a lot of ribbing that goes on in our office as i think back to this conversation a recurring topic i must admit i realize that it really is a good thing that i own the company or i would have been fired a long time ago in fact knowing what i know i would have fired myself you see i have three companies and they are all set up to run on systems which are efficient and time-saving this means i don't have to do much to keep them going yet they are all profitable and they all contribute to my personal finances quite well i do come into the office this may be either habit or maybe because my wife caren would rather have me out of the house and not bugging her to start yet another short term project that might or might not be completed in six months time either way i learned a while ago that the goal for my businesses was to create systems that benefited the customers the employees and owners while not taking up too much of my time it has been said that a business owner can work any sixteen ours of the day that he chooses this is true if you don't build a beautiful business a beautiful business is one that is set up to work with systems it is a business that requires very little input from the owner is profitable and rewards all all of the stakeholders customers employees and owners my stated goal is to become the most useless person in the business this is because i do not want to be a crucial part of the business i want to be able to leave for a month at a time and not have ten or twenty phone calls a day from employees asking how to do this or how to do that i don't want to be involved in the day to day workings i want to set up systems whereby the business takes care of itself and the employees can be handsomely rewarded for doing their jobs and for creatively improving their jobs i want to be able to see a few reports that tell me everything i need to know in a matter of minutes in short i i want to own the business not have the business own me you can create your own beautiful business and eventually be amazed that you two are spending five minutes a week doing the hard labor before you head onto the golf course or drive home to spend extra time with your family or sit down to consider starting your second company my four reasons i will offer up for different and important reasons for why you might want to own a business control of culture time opportunities involvement of children and continuity of a family owned business who created this chaos the first of these four reasons is that my owning a business you can control the culture what i mean by control the culture is that you as a business owner are able to set the environment around which you're going to work if you want to work in a business where there is high stress a lot of requirements and things moving at breakneck speed you can create this culture if you want to but if you'd rather have a culture that is more laid back where you have more time for people and people do not feel they are obligated to work sixty five to eighty hours per week in order to progress in your business then you can develop this type of culture as well one of the companies that i own is a software company we write business management software for landscape companies many years ago i received a call from the secretary of a customer company when i was doing tech support she said hey i'm brand new i have to learn how to use your song where i have to learn how to install all this business management software and accounting software i have to be able to print route sheets by tomorrow and have payroll out by friday can you help me i spent rs on the phone with this lady trying to help her through this massive amount of work that had been dropped in her lap about three days later i received another call from the same company from a different person saying hey i'm a new employee i need to have all the software installed i have to have route sheets by tomorrow and payroll by friday and you help me i said well i just dealt with somebody a few days ago for the very the same thing oh yes well she left i was informed i said oh okay well let me help you this happened about three times in a row every few days i'd get a call from a new person that had just been hired at this company by the third time this happened i said you know what,1
B00NEZUDYG,can come up with a great business idea if they're willing to take the time to learn the right skills and build the right toolkit to get it done now i bet if you're listening to this course it's probably because you're thinking about starting a business yourself or maybe it's something you've always wanted to do but you're not really sure where to begin my best advice to you if you're in this situation is that if you want to start a great business you need to build it on a great idea so that's where we'll start now where do you fit find great business ideas well the answer to that can be found all around us but to see them you have to learn to look at the world in a fundamentally different way you need to look at the world through the eyes of an entrepreneur but what do i mean by that well entrepreneurs really pay attention to the world around them entrepreneurship first and foremost is about seeing what's missing in the world and then figuring out a way to make it better it's about keen observation and water are entrepreneurs looking for they're looking for problems and everyone has problems families athletes companies even governments i'm sure even today while going through the motions of your daily life you experience several problems for frustrations or things that could have gone more smoothly or things that could have been more enjoyable or more comfortable and when you encountered these problems you may have felt a little irritated or even annoyed and that makes sense when most people think about problems they they think about them in negative terms you see people normally associate a problem with a crisis or a disaster or a barrier and these words can bring feelings of trouble and fear problems have a heavy air about them and we avoid them when possible these negative perceptions cause us to avoid problems rather than seeking problems and as a result we often procrastinate in handling them i know i've been guilty of that myself and you probably have to or we only work on the easy problems to solve because we fear that we can't come up with a solution to the to the harder problems but there is another way of looking at problems a more positive way let's think of positive words associated with problems that would be words like challenge goal objective and best of all opportunity this is how we want to see problems we want to see them as opportunities and this is exactly what the great entrepreneurs do you see for an entrepreneur every single problem that arise this from daily life represents an opportunity entrepreneurs get excited by problems and they're eager to learn more about them because the best way to create a product or service that people will love is to solve a problem for them now this can be difficult but if we address problems we can improve lives and that's what entrepreneurs do when they solve problems that customers have they in prove lives and better yet they improve the world you see when you begin to see problems as opportunities you've made the first giant step yep towards thinking like an entrepreneur and that means you've made a step toward making the world a better place too and you quickly realize that great business ideas are really all around you so if you can offer a great solution to a big problem that enough people have then you have the beginnings of a great business let me give you an example of someone i know who makes good money doing this and he has a lot of fun in the process kevin brooks is an airbrush artist in louisville kentucky but he's also an entrepreneur and he's learned to think like one he spent his working career your custom painting cars in his shop now kevin has been very successful at this but he'd been looking for another revenue stream to add to his business,1

B00HVLQUFA,the prize had been so complete that she dipped into the scotch decanter she didn't know if the mill depicted in the painting was real but there was a cider broke in knightsbridge barely two hours west of boston of all places a quick internet search had produced a year old notice that the town of knightsbridge was selling an old cider mill in it's possession had some one bought it was it still for sale samantha had checked the closet for anything else her grandfather might have stuffed in there related to cider brook instead she discovered a legal size envelope containing about fifty yellowed handwritten pages the rough draft of a story called the adventures of captain faraday and lady elizabeth she suspected but had no way to prove that the story was by the same hand as the painting but it didn't matter it had sealed the deal and now she had harry bennett's antique silver flask tucked in her jacket and her plans made for her return to knightsbridge a town she had expected and hoped she would never have to visit again plans more or less made anyway samantha had no illusions about herself and knew she wasn't much on detailed planning her first visit to the little town had been two and a half years ago on a snowy march day a few months after her grandfather's death she had expected to slip in and out of town without anyone's knowledge but it hadn't worked out that way a carpenter told me he saw a woman out here you samantha yes her the carpenter had been her undoing she didn't know who he was but it didn't matter she would be more careful on this trip even if careful wasn't a bennett trait this was her chance to put things right samantha return the painting to the closet pulled the drapes locked the doors and met her uncle and cousin out front they had collected her grandfather's forty year old mercedes from it's parking space behind the house it was a stayed gray and had massachusetts plates but it was destined to stand out in knightsbridge in some ways harry bennett's frugal upbringing had never left him while he'd bought an expensive car he decided to keep it until he ran it into the ground it would have helped if he'd driven it once in a while but he never liked to drive his younger son however loved to drive caleb bennett was a rakish the handsome maritime historian in his early fifties he and his wife a rare book specialist lived outside london and were the parents of four the eldest of whom isaac a high school senior was strapped into the seat behind samantha isaac and his father were heading to amherst the first stop on the tour of new england college's samantha who didn't own a car was hitching a ride with them this will be great caleb said as she got in next to him i can't remember the last time i drove into the new england countryside are you sure you don't want me to drive now sit back and enjoy yourself the three youngest bennett's would be arriving in boston with their mother that evening for a week long visit at some point samantha's parents were due to arrive from the scottish coast for an even shorter visit a sort of family reunion her uncle and isaac would pick her up in knightsbridge on their way back to boston caleb pulled out onto busy beacon street it was late september a great time to be in boston or anywhere in new england he glanced at samantha you look as if you're about to walk the plank do i i don't feel that way i'm excited add bastard duncan mccaffrey fired you sam going back to knightsbridge just picked the scab off a wound that should be healed by now isaac leaned forward duncan mccaffrey the treasure hunter samantha his throat tightened but she tried not to let them see her tension she and isaac shared the bennett golden brown hair and dark eyes but he was lanky angular and a gifted tennis player she was active but had no patience for tennis and at five five she had obviously not inherited the bay bennett height even her mother francesca a marine archaeologist was taller samantha considered herself lucky to have inherited her beautiful mother's high cheekbones and full mouth,0
B07FQWYHB7,the harvest pilgrims came to the last tabernacle as they always had they trod the half severed stalks down and sent their prayer smoke into the blue sky are slowly gathering tide of people old and young man and woman all clad in the sacred blue of rain thousands of them had already gathered around the tabernacle they they swirled about it white smoke puffing from their fume pipes scenting the air with fruit and spice credulous fools muttered and ankara as she guided one of her hawks lower over the scene the creatures were cyber bonded their eyes and will hers the pilgrims throng was swaying like the crops that it had stood where they now walked whooping prayers lifted into the air inside the tent of glass the priests were gathering around the altar box she could see them sway as they sang their secret songs and swung incense smoke around the reliquary from their point of view her seeing this would be a blasphemy she was not of the priesthood and not initiated into the mysteries of the emperor's eternal light the pilgrims who circled the tabernacle would have torn her apart if they had known that she could see a priest opened the first leaf of the reliquary they would have been even more incensed that she could see an acolyte at the back of the group pick his nose a kilometer away from them she snorted with laughter something diverting asked memnon no she said still watching the priests not really just don't you sometimes think humanities too petty for divinity if we found the empress frozen tears someone would give them to a child as a toy that is what defines the divine that is beyond us if you say so i do seen from above the tabernacle itself was a mountain made of triangular sheets of glass each one tethered to another the smallest on the outside just a couple of meters tall the largest over fifty meters in height it's apex was a blade point thrust at the sun even though each sheet of glass was transparent though i stood on the outside could see only a handful of layers inside rainbows of blinding light scattered from it's faces and edges hiding the sanctuary at it's core once the ceremony began only a few of the pilgrims would be allowed inside there was no straight way to the center of the structure just an ever weaving path between sheets of riff election if a pilgrim reached the sanctuary itself they would be able to turn and thanks to the precise setting of each glass pane see perfectly in every direction she opened her true eyes and for a moment felt vertigo as the site from her hawks clashed with the world in front of her then the two split and the hawks iview receded to the back of her mind i see no indications of the prospect she said memnon reached beneath his robes and withdrew a small box of bone ash tattoos marched down his cheeks in rows of tiny dots each one faded to gray his patchwork robes fluttered in the warm breeze he alone was not dressed in pilgrim blue but in the faded and torn cloth that he always wore then kara had often thought that he looked more like a beggar or an ascetic monk than an inquisitor he looked young at least young in the way that people judge such things may be no more than three decades to the ai nikkor saw his lips move in silent prayer where before he opened the lid of the box he took a pinch of dust from within and cast it into the air the grey powder caught the breeze memnon watched it face impassive until it dissolved into the wind then kara had no idea what he looked for but she knew that he saw more than dust vanishing on the wind it is coming he said at last order the gunships to come in then kara obeyed transmitting the command with a thought i am reading low grade atmospheric interference across multiple spectra getting voice was a scratched patchwork of c static and voice samples the all spectra was sweating profusely under the sun's glare sweat stuck her blue pilgrim's robe to her hunched body bulbous curves of metal gleamed in the gaps between the lank cloth the heat sinks of her signal and scanning arrays must have been cooking her reflected in ankara static and moisture levels are rising pressure inversion unfolding at one hundred meters above ground level what does that mean asked ning cara glancing back that is a storm coming said gettin then cora snorted it's clear blue to beyond horizon she said no said memnon softly and raised a hand to point up look linker have followed the line of his long finger she squinted against the light raising a hand to shield her eyes then she saw it a smudge of white in the clear air august of air tugged at her robe and she was aware of the same wind pulling at her hawks as they turned above the tabernacle ill may wish to bring yard beds back said gettin all readings are spiking above the tabernacle the patch of cloud was growing expanding up and out darkening she could hear the voices of pilgrims rising in puzzlement through the eyes of her hawks she saw the black dots of the gunships rise from above the horizon even the voices of the priests in the tabernacle were faltering the outer layer have glass shook in the rising wind ratings across all parameters are reaching paradox rasped gettin the hawks spiral down out of the darkening sky then cara could feel it now metal on her tongue static shivering on the inside of her skin the massive pilgrims we're looking up at the thunderhead darkening the air above them some were crying out some were already running we have targets locked and weapons live said a voice in encourage voc speed the gunships were visible now the sound of engines growled across the distance do you have a triangulation asked memnon calmly now lord shouted gettin her fingers clacking the keys of the controls that took the place of her left arm phenomenon and paradox traces are changing too rapidly that prospect is not clear very well said memnon gunships into jaya pattern nothing that runs lives he began to walk down the gentle slope towards the tabernacle and the crowd of pilgrims we will need to identify the prospect directly there is not much time the hawks and encourage shoulders took to the air with shrill cries as she followed him lightning flashed inside the cloud above them thunder rolled come said memnon we must be pilgrims now,0
B071GDCLRK,in the predictive analytics blackbox to more confidently apply these models to or be able to communicate with data scientists after listening to this chapter marketers will have a good understanding of the entire predictive analytics process there are three types of predictive analytics models that marketers should know about unsafe supervised learning supervised learning and reinforcement learning many marketers don't realize that eighty percent of the work associated with predicting future consumer behavior is going towards collecting and cleaning customer data this data janitor work is not glamorous but essential without accurate and complete customer data there can be no meaningful customer analytics chapter three get to know your customers first build complete customer profiles building complete and accurate customer profiles is no easy task but it has a lot of value if yours is like most companies customer data is all over the place full of errors and duplicate and not accessible to everyday marketers fortunately predictive technology including fuzzy matching can help that lie used some to clean up your data mess and to connect online and offline data to resolve customer identities across the digital and physical divide just getting all customer data in one place has enormous value and making customer profiles accessible to customer facing personnel throughout the organization is a great first step app to start to deliver better experiences to each and every customer chapter four managing your customers as a portfolio to improve your evaluation it is our strong belief that the best way for any business to optimize enterprise value is to optimize the customer lifetime value of each and every customer customers are the unit of value for any company and therefore customer lifetime value is the most important metric in marketing if you maximize the lifetime value or profitability of each and every customer you also maximize the profitability and valuation of your company as a whole the best way to optimize lifetime value for all customers is to manage your customers as if they were a stock portfolio you take different actions and send different messages for cusp gamers who were brand new then for those who have been doing business with you for awhile you'll need to adjust your thinking and budget for unprofitable medium value and high value customers chapter five play one optimize your marketing spending using customer data when asked to allocate marketing budgets most marketers immediately think about acquisition spending and about allocating budget to the best performing channels and products however the predictive marketing way to allocate spending is based on allocating dollars to the right people rather than to the right products or channels most companies are focused on acquisition whereas they could achieve growth more cost effectively by focusing more of their time and budget on retention and reactivation of customers marketers should learn to allocate budgets based on their goals to acquire retain and reactivate customers and define products and channels that do deliver the highest value customers chapter six play to predict customer personas and make marketing relevant again we'll look at the predictive technique of clustering and how it's different from classical customer segmentation clustering is a powerful tool in order to discover personas or communities in your customer base specifically in this chapter we look at product based brand based and behavior based clusters as examples clustering can be used to gain insight into differences in customers' needs behaviors demographics atta dudes and preferences regarding marketing interactions products and service usage using these clusters you can also start to differentiate and optimize both marketing actions and product strategy for different groups of customers chapter seven play three predict the customer journey for life cycle marketing in this chapter we look at the customer life cycle in more detail from acquisition to growth and to retention and see how your engagement strategy should evolve with each and every customer during the life cycle the basic principle of optimizing customer lifetime value is the same for all stages of the life cycle and can be summarized in three words give to get customers are much more likely to buy from you if they trust,1

B0080JBM5A,traditional way of life could be a member of the hindu community originally hinduism was confined to india crossing the dark sea emigrating to the west was associated with loss of caste and exclusion from the hindu community nowadays there are an estimated forty five million hindus living outside india of whom about eighteen million live in nepal the only country in the world which has declared hinduism it state religion and about fifteen million in bangladesh the former east bengal about two million hindus live in western europe and north america and modern hindu missionary movements also attract westerners to their fold granting them equal status with born hindus hinduism appears in a bewildering variety of shapes and forms and is presented and interpreted by it's adherents in such a multitude of ways that it is extremely difficult to describe and impossible to define as far as it's content is concerned while in the west it is treated as one of the major religions in the world for hindus it is much more than that it is a way of life a large and rich culture and environment that envelops a hindu from before birth to after death what we call hinduism hindus themselves designate as sanatana dharma eternal law it is identical with universally valid and generally binding insights and precepts specified so as to accord with individual standing within society within the framework of the senate and and dharma a great many different some pro dias religious communities with specific beliefs rituals and places of worship flourish traditions that have histories of thousands of years like hinduism or christianity have branched out into many different phenotypes that are often in opposition to each other adherents of one of the existing branches often claim to be the only true representatives of tradition accusing others of having betrayed or misinterpreted the original message from such a sectarian standpoint it would be meaningless to attempt a global description of the tradition as a whole and one would have to content oneself with a parallel treatment of major religious communities however what appears to the insider as essential difference is often seen by the outsider as but a variation on a theme that can be perceived and traced back to the origins in a representation of hinduism as a whole as is attempted here we will not overlook the major differences that brought the major and minor some prayers into existence and make them the communities they are we will however aim not to lose the larger perspectives and emphasize common origins as well as common themes that tie the hundreds of different manifestations of hinduism together that makes it meaningful to speak of hinduism instead of juxtaposing detailed descriptions of hundreds of unrelated communities that each have their own peculiar beliefs and practices in this beginner's guide we shall deal with four approaches designed to throw light on various dimensions of hinduism one the cultural sociological framework provided by the vedic tradition to which all hindus subscribe at least nominally to the great diversity of religions such as vaishnav ism shave ism shack tourism and their subdivisions which separates hindus into many different and sometimes competitive communities three the intense intellectual quest that led to the development of numerous philosophical schools concerned with universal issues for the developments within hinduism triggered off by it's encounter with the modern west since the late eighteenth century as one would expect there is a wide spread of individual commitment and active practice of religion among hindus there are those who devote their entire lives to practicing and propagating a particular devote,0

B003D8YHO6,islands that eventually came together to form the city now there are lots of popular misconceptions about vanna some of them we will dispel in this course wild mentioned just a few before we start just so we start off on the right foot first of all venice does not float it is not a fly floating city doesn't go up and down on the water as the as the waves come although you might not know it if you've seen some betrayals of venice even in for example the movies in the most recent example that i know of was the james bond movie casino royale in which the final climactic scene occurs in a large venetian plot so on the grand canal and in the scene james bond rushes downstairs and blows out the giant air tanks that keep the palazzo floating and then you had this very tense scene in which the fighting continues on while this palazzo is crumbling apart and sinking fire finally the entire palazzo a six story palazzo sinks completely into the water after which james bond's girlfriend dies and drowns in the water there are many things wrong with that as i said one the buildings do not float all of venice is an island these are sandy islands that were kind of meh marshy islands that were settled a very long time ago and the venetians were able to build on those islands because they drove very large wooden logs really into the sand and very close together and the tops of those logs then became the foundation on which they placed the stones and then built a very large buildings that you see today have very solid construction because of that venice also doesn't have any basements or catacombs if you've seen the movie indiana jones and the last crusade there is another tense chase scene in which indiana jones works his way through the catacombs of venice and eventually fat comes out on a manhole in the piazza san marco the the great a large piazza that everyone thinks of when they think of venice there are manholes in the piazza in fact they're actually not for men therefore a water to make it's way when the water pressure gets too high so no one would actually go through there but from what we've just learned and about dennis and how it was constructed clearly couldn't have a basement the basement our logs are giant wooden logs that were driven into the sand in some cases a thousand years ago the interesting thing is that the mixture of the salt water and the sand perfectly preserves these logs and many of them as i said are thousand years or more old and they're still very much like they were when they were first placed down there well how then did venice get started and will will begin at the beginning venice unlike almost all of the other cities in italy was not a city during the roman empire there was no venice during ancient rome venice is geographically is a lagoon it's a portion that the very northern portion of the adriatic were several rivers particularly the po bow river empty out into the adriatic sea there are certain long islands or leidos as they're called which form therefore a lagoon behind these leidos and the silt that comes down from the rivers builds up in this lagoon and that means that some islands com and some islands go they tend to be very sandy and marshy in the lagoon throughout it there are waterways through this as the water tries to make it's way out past the lady into the adriatic sea so in general it's not a very good good place to build a city it's not it would not be your first choice and it never was anyone's first choice to build a city during the ancient roman empire there was nothing out there we know there were people who lived out there who would be fishermen they would have small huts on some of the higher islands and there is all also people who made a living with salt because of the way the water is in the lagoon you can set up these salt catches so that you can catch the salt water in a very shallow area then cut it off allow the sun to evaporate it and then collect all the sauce lt and salt was in high demand just as it is today when the roman empire fell as it was falling in the west you had a lot of these various germanic barbarian group,0

B00DD56K7Q,still listening and responding to wordsworth and keats and blake and byron in vital ways i also take my lead from t s eliot who was no professed friend to the romantics perhaps because he recognized in their models for what he himself was and did but who said that we must treat poems as though they are poems and not something else therefore this will be a course that will deal primarily with certain great poems by six great poets secondarily it will give you some information about their lives and the way those lives provided the necessary but not sufficient conditions for the writing of their poetry at an even more subordinate level the lectures will necessarily entail some background information in philosophy history politics and with the critic william hazlitt referred to as the spirit of the age the main focus will be on the work of wordsworth coleridge blake byron shelley and keats the so called canon of six let me say something right away about this choice tastes are always changing and one generation's preferences are not guaranteed to be those of the next generation a classic in other words is not something inscribed in stone or marble but it's more like a mirror something in which we see ourselves reflected a great work will answer whatever questions are put to it and those questions change of course with the times and with the identities of the questioners it's a fact that the six men i have selected who have been at the top of the list for about the past fifty years were by no means the most popular poets in england during their own lifetime blake was relatively unknown and obscure wordsworth was mocked and with coleridge was attacked during his youthful days for what was regarded by hostile critics as political radicalism and banal writing keats was condescended to for his affiliation with the radical writer lee hunt lord byron didn't have much respect for any of the others with the exception of shelley a and in this case the appeal was personal and class based rather than artistic byron was a runaway best seller in the second decade of the nineteenth century but his status was due more to the scandals of his life than the perceived merit of this verse the most popular writers of the day were men and women whom we tend to value much less today samuel rogers tom moore sir walter scott anna barbeau helen maria williams and maria edgeworth for example i've included in this series one talk on the women writers who were popular in their day then sank into lesser renown and later were revived within the past two decades by feminist critics and sky scholars who have performed interesting acts of retrieval the plight of the romantic said something about the rise and fall of literary fashions during the heyday of the high modern period which was roughly the first half of the twentieth century when the tastes of eliot and ezra pound ruled supreme in the anglo american world the stock of the romantics had sunk pretty low after world war two a new generation of critics and readers led by professor harold bloom at yale and northrop frye and co canada began an upward revaluation blake who had been dismissed out of hand as a madman was given a new and respectful look shelly whose lyric pronouncements were dismissed as so much airy nonsense came to look like a hardheaded skeptical radical thinker byron investigated changing ideas about gender sex roles and sexuality and so it goes tastes and fashion change now i want to say something about my subject my terminology and my tastes it's hard to say what romanticism is or even when it was when did it begin where how and why no answers are available and this is in fact a romantic dilemma how do we find starting places for practically anything in life when wordsworth in his autobiography tries to think of beginnings and origins he comes up against a solid brick wall no one can remember everything and memory it will turn out both its glories and it's failures is one of the great roma attic subjects wordsworth asks how shall i seek the origin this is of course the question that a person going through psychoanalysis must also ask him or herself beginnings are not easy to identify even for example with respect to life consider the burning question from contemporary medical ethics when does life begin at birth at the moment of conception at some other point within the development of an embryo these are romantic questions although everyone now uses the term,0
B07H12JVC1,it is important to recognize that although this book does contain coaching on several practical tools approaches and their effective use the final ingredient that will cause you to have a transformative experience is your willingness to examine how the concepts apply to you your personal experience at this point in your journey the insight and wisdom that is revealed to you relative to your specific situation is always far more beneficial than any theoretical knowledge you can gain from an external source this type of learning is an inside out process and it often brings about a whole new paradigm that completely shifts how you relate to yourself and the world around you i experienced this a few years ago in an assignment that involved a major turnaround in results relying on what i knew i started taking steps that i felt needed to be taken and we began to make some progress however we soon hit a plateau and found ourselves stuck until i discovered things that i didn't know that i didn't know i'm refer going to things like the realization that the greatest barrier to progress was my own self righteousness and refusal to embrace a style that was different than the one that had always worked for me in the past once this was revealed to me and i went to work on it we went on to make extraordinary progress in less than two years we were delivering the best results in the company and surpassing industry benchmarks in several areas as a bonus we also enjoyed all the benefits of skyrocketing morale that no one had thought possible jus just a couple of years earlier having an epiphany can completely transform your world view and experience of life and most of the time it comes out of nowhere when you least expect it in my case i remember the exact day like it was yesterday when it became clear to me that the problem was not something out there air but rather in how i related to the challenges i was facing i also remember that just prior to that i had been busy doing more of what hadn't been working and simply playing whack-a-mole with my issues my intention throughout this book is to create a transformative experience for you that allows you to have many of the same types of realizations unfortunately leaving yourself open to that type of revelation is not a straightforward process it is not about following a linear path of learning one thing and then another rather is quite the opposite it requires lateral thinking that you go against your natural tendency easy to build on what you already know and instead explore counter intuitive approaches that are discontinuous and could yield major breakthroughs this section of the book serves to prepare you to not simply learn what is being taught but to more importantly make you aware of why you're not acting on what you already know it requires you to truly leave yourself open to receiving new insights in other words you must decide discover what is in the way and get it out of the way so that you can move forward at a rate that you hadn't thought possible as the saying goes when the student is ready the teacher will appear you will get what you are ready to receive and that is just fine but to enhance your experience i'd ask you to consider the following did you hear what i said beware of the secretary of your brain also known as your reticular activating system or r a s it is perfectly designed and programmed to give you access to what you already believe filter and information you are interested in and filter everything ing else out this part of our mental anatomy serves a very important function in that it keeps us sane by not letting our brains get overloaded with useless information the downside however is that it also blocks out some pertinent information,1
B07FW7B4YX,forward i have come to know candy jones and john nebel well over the last several years both as an invited guest on their radio program and as a psychiatrist as part of their efforts to unravel many perplexing questions about candy's past they asked me to examine her especially in regard to her capacity to be hypnotized after a detailed clinical history we evaluated her extensively utilizing standard psychological testing including the thematic apperception test and the rorschach she these indicated that she suffered epic sadik periods of stress but not of the psychotic or schizophrenic level we then employed a clinical measurement of hypnotize ability the hypnotic induction profile h i p in order to assess candies trans capacity this test has been developed and standardized over ten years in a large population of patients and seems to reliably indicate the extent to which an individual is hypnotized will such tests are important because hypnosis is a capacity which individuals possess to varying degrees and which changes little in a given person within the passage of time hypnosis is not a quality projected onto someone by a hypnotist rather it is an ability inherent in the individual candies responds to the hypnotic induction profile indicated the cheese extremely hypnotize abul and this outcome was confirmed independently by two two other psychiatrists her trans capacity places her in a small group of highly hypnotized abul individuals who comprise no more than ten percent of the population this high hypnotise ability makes plausible her capacity to regress to earlier times in her life and to act as though she were in the present it is also consistent with her global amnesia that is her complete forgetting of many events in her life such a distinction is important because as a rule those who have a lower capacity for hypnosis are far less susceptible to extreme colonel influence of the kind described in this book for example john neville's response to the hypnotic induction profile indicated that he is at best minimally hypnotise apple had he reported about himself such a story of secret influences and amnesia for vast portions of his life and had he claim to have an experience spontaneous bursts of regression i would have been quite skeptical hypnosis like many medical techniques can be used for both good and evil a hypnotized individual has the ability to make choices about complying with any suggestion however the more hypnotize abul a person is the more inclined he or she will be to comply with signals or comma mounds and to suspend their usual critical judgment slipping into the trance state is something like shifting into high gear in an automobile any change in the direction of motion is magnified thus many individuals have been helped considerably by learning about and by utilizing their own trans capacities at the same time our research has indicated that some highly hypnotized will people will do relatively uncharacteristic things while in a trance state in one experiment a highly hypnotized bl subject entered a trance state and was told to believe that there was a communist conspiracy to take over the television networks such a belief was clearly contrary to his usual political orientation yet after leaving the trial state he vehemently defended this belief during an intense filmed interview with frank mcgee the television news commentator now deceased the subject went so far as to create names and places and even began to openly suspect mcgee himself months later when the subject viewed his performance on film he was surprised and baffled at his own behavior he had total amnesia of the entire filmed episode note this and many similar clinical experiences have led me to believe that highly hypnotise able individuals are especially vulnerable to certain kinds of outside influence and manipulation such individuals may find themselves doing things which are in some degree at variance with the normal code of values in the extreme it is even possible that they may be manipulated into performing acts of physical violence all people are prone to being molded by outside influence to some extent the small group of highly hypnotized will people when put in the hands of unscrupulous individuals are even more vulnerable another lesson of the filmed interview with the subject who'd been told to believe that the communists had taken over the networks is that hypnotized subjects are also vulnerable to deception their desire to comply both in and out of the formal trance is such that they may convincingly invent info animation in an effort to give the hypnotist what he seems to want they can even deceive themselves thus interviews utilizing hypnotic age regression for the purpose of uncovering information must be performed carefully and dispassionately further external corroborating evidence is crucial for verification of material produced in a regret one study without external confirmation of data the possibility of stress hallucination is not ruled out it is well established however that under carefully controlled conditions highly hypnotizes people can regress in time and uncover incredibly accurate and subtle factual and emotional experiences buried in the remote memory of the past the control of candy jones is a fascinating and compelling book i believe that john candy and the author donald bain have struggled to uncover the truth although i share in the frustration of the difficulties involved in obtaining external documentation i was not involved in the actual spontaneous and induced hypnotic age regression with candy as reported in the book but it is clear from my work with her the cheese capable of such intense hypnotic experiences further outside evidence is important in evaluating can a story and i view this book as an interim report knowing that candy john and donald bain are determined to uncover as much information as possible john's patience and sensitivity to unexpected cues is matched by candy's persistent desire to serve is all available memories finally i respect their courage in openly pursuing such a troubling and frightening personal story herbert spiegel md,0
B00H7MUXK6,and then perhaps you have a drink or dinner with another prospect he was selling five and ten times as much as me or anyone else in our office and he hardly seemed to be working at all training makes the difference it turned out that he had worked for a fortune five hundred company when he was younger that company had spent sixteen months training him intensively in the process of professional selling with those skills he could then go to work for any company or industry and sell any product or service in virtually any market because he knew how to sell he could sell circles around people like me even though he was working half the time or less this discovery changed my life when i asked him what he was doing differently he said well show me your sales presentation or critique it for you that was my first problem i had no idea what a sales presentation looked like i had heard that there was such a thing but i had never seen one myself i said you show me yours and i'll show you mine he was patient and polite and he said ok here's a basic sales presentation from beginning to end he then walked me step-by-step through a sales presentation for our product instead of using a speech or clever one liners to get attention or to overcome resistance he asked a series of logical questions from general to specific that were ideally suited to a genuine prospect at the end of the series of questions it'll become perfectly clear to the prospect that he could use and benefit from our product the final question was simply to close the sale take action immediately well i wrote everything down fortified with his new approach to selling i went out and started calling on prospects once more but this time instead of talking i asked questions rather than trying to overwhelm the prospect with features and benefits of my product i focused on learning about the prospect's situation and how i could best help him or her with this new method my sales went up then i learned about books on selling i had no idea that some of the best salespeople in the world had written some of the best ideas on selling in books i began reading everything i could find on selling spending the first two hours of every day studying and taking notes next i learned about audio learning it changed my life i began to listen hour after hour to audio programs as i walk from office to office i listened to them in the morning i listen to them in the evening i rehearsed and practiced the best sentences and phrases from the best salespeople until i could recite them in my sleep and my sail i went up and up then i discovered sales seminars i thought i died and gone to heaven i had no idea how much you could learn from a sales seminar i began to take every seminar course i could find even if i had to travel long distances which i did and which i could eventually afford to do and my sales continued to increase moving into management my sales were so high that my company made me a sales manager they said whatever you're smoking find some people who want to get into sales and share it with him i began to recruit salespeople off the street and through newspaper as i showed them my methodology and process of selling they walked out the door and began making sales immediately today many of them are millionaires and multimillionaires be the best the simple idea that changed my life was the discovery of the law of cause and effect but this law says is that there is a cause for every effect that everything happens for a reason success is not an accident failure is not an accident either in fact success is predictable it leaves tracks here's a great rule if you do what other successful people do over and over again nothing in the world can stop you from eventually getting the same results that they do and if you don't nothing can help you remember that everyone in the top ten percent in sales today started in the bottom ten percent all who are doing well today were once doing poorly everyone at the front of the line of life started at the back of the line and in every case what these top people did was to learn from the experts they discovered were others thought people were doing to be successful and they did the same things themselves again and again until they got the same result and so can you use what you learn sometimes i ask my sales audiences what is the most popular piece of home exercise equipment in america after a little hesitation i tell them it's the treadmill americans spend more than one billion dollars on treadmills every single year then i ask a second question if you buy a treadmill and take it home what will determine how much benefit you get from that treadmill they answer,1
B01B3BNKFQ,so much larger than life or so i thought everywhere i look now reminds me of what i've lost and nothing feels right or the same even tiddlywinks the wooden rocking horse i surprised her with at christmas twenty twelve looked so sad and lonely as i'm now feeling standing in the corner by the living room window hope i never forget how absolutely thrilled linda was when i gave her a tiny gift wrap box on christmas morning we were staying in a hotel in bradford because she was appearing as the fairy godmother in the panto cinderella with the repairs as she didn't have enough time off between performances to warrant travel all the way home for only a few hours inside the box was a miniature rocking horse oh michael isn't that beautiful big key as she guessed recognize the intricate model from her my tasty travel series for itv the previous summer linda had traveled around in an old vw camper van interview and skilled craftsmen and women as i tagged along behind one of them was a man a cocking to rock and horses into k and i had a quiet word with him when she wasn't around i laughed a shot face when told outta that this wasn't the real christmas present a full size version was on order i will be arriving at home the following spray she loved the beautiful rocking horses when she watched them be made made each one by hand and said how much she'd like one for her grandchildren up until then there was michael's son sasha and stacey's boys cooper and oakley of course linda hope that one day she might see more arrived to ride tiddlywinks not to be i'm afraid my lover this was linda's nickname for me always spoken in a mimic west country accent light by all those hopes when even them without either of us knowing it the cancer was already at work it was the same christmas that we ended up in casualty in bradford after the second pancho show on christmas eve then to have been suffering from really bad ingestion and diarrhea i'm sure a breath when we finally saw a doctor her he said it was probably nothing and prescribed omeprazole a drug that reduces stomach acid for a couple of weeks she did so and it seemed to clear up if only we'd known as we find out later though it probably would have been too late even then i was really surprised to discover after the funeral thought it was the actual smell of linda that i miss so much especially on sundays bloody sundays whether it's because sundays used to be so great when we were together or whether it's because i lost her on a sunday and the bad memories takeover i can't say all i know is that what was always the best day of our week immediately became my worst day overnight i started the hate sundays absolutely hate them the worst ever was the first sunday after the funeral on the ninth of november twenty fourteen i miss linda like crazy from the minute i woke up still on the same side of our king sized bed the one nearest to the bedroom door in case burglars ever broken will i promise to always protect her in front of all her friends and family a fair few of whom were dubious of me in my wedding speech i meant it literally to be fair every morning since i lost her i started badly still does but wheat days and even saturdays are busy generally places to go people to see sunday spent at home alone stretch nsc of front of me even if either rise to go i meet somebody for lunch pat for instance is what i get at my lowest automatically first thing in the morning my arm still reaches across to the young crumpled colder empty side and it's the smell however i noticed that is missing even first thing in the morning linda ois my smell gorgeous i think it was the cream she used unlike me she didn't light shower she left a nice steep old fashioned bath i even shook our fancy spa bath one that was in here when we bought this place to install a normal bathtub every night at ub by ten p m she'd lie in it for three quarters of an hour or so while i watch tv next door in the bedroom once we had a laugh when the dress designer vivienne westwood admitted to the papers that she doesn't shower either and only has bath in her husband's water linda love reminded me that when the country was she hit by the cirrus trite in the summer of ninety seventy six people were actually been revised to save water bath with a friend yet the only,0
B0030EJV3U,there is little or no magic about them except the ordinary everyday sort which helps them to disappear quietly and quickly when large stupid folk like you and me come blundering along making a noise like elephants which they can hear a mile off they are inclined to be fat in the stomach they dress in bright colors chiefly green and yellow wear no shoes because their feet grow natural leathery soles and thick warm brown hair like the stuff on their heads which is curly have long clever brown fingers good natured faces and laugh deep fruity laughs isp specially after dinner which they have twice a day when they can get it now you know enough to go on with as i was saying the mother have this habit of bilbo baggins that is was the fabulous belladonna took one of the three remarkable daughters of the old took head of the hobbits who lived across the water the small river that ran at the foot of the hill it was often said in other families that long ago one of the took ancestors must have taken a ferry wife that was of course absurd but certainly there was still something not entirely hobbit like about them and once in awhile members of the tuk clan would go and have adventures they discreetly disappeared and the family hushed it up but the fact remains that the the talks were not as respectable as the baggins as though they were undoubtedly richer not that belladonna took ever had any adventures after she became mrs bongo beckons tango that was bilbo's father built the most luxurious hobbit hole for her and partly with her money that was to be found either under the hill or over the hill or across the water and there they remained to the end of their days still it is probable that bilbo her only son although he looked and behaved exactly like a second edition of his solid and comfortable father got something a bit queer in his makeup from the took side something that only waited for a chance to come out the chance never arrived until bilbo baggins was grown up being about fifty years old or so and living in the beautiful hobbit hole built by his father which i have just described for you until he had in fact apparently settled down in movably by some curious chance one morning long ago in the quiet of the world when there was less noise and more green and the hobbits were still numerous and prosperous and bilbo baggins was standing at his door after breakfast smoking an enormous long wooden pipe that reached nearly down to usually toes neatly brushed gandalf came by gandalf if you had heard only a quarter of what i have heard about him and i have only heard very little of all there is to hear you would be prepared for any sort of remarkable tale tales and adventures sprouted up all over the place wherever he went in the most extraordinary fare ocean he had not been down that way under the hill for ages and ages not since his friend the old took died in fact and the hobbits had almost forgotten what he looked like he had been away over the hill and across the water on business of his own since they were all small hobbit boys and hobbit girls all that the unsuspecting bilbo saw that morning was an old man with a staff he had a tall pointed blue hat along great cloak a silver scarf over a which a white beard hung down below his waist and immense black boots good morning said bilbo and he meant it the sun was shining and the grass was very green but again doubtful looked at him from under long bushy eyebrows that stuck out further than the brim of his shady hat what do you mean he said do you wish me a good morning or i mean that it is a good morning whether i want it or not or that you feel good this morning or that it is a morning to be good on all of them at once said bilbo and a very fine morning for a pipe of tobacco out of doors into the bargain if you have a pipe about you sit down and overfill of mine there's no hurry we have all the day before us then bilbo sat down on a seat by his door crossed his legs and blew out a beautiful grey,0
B01LDCJP04,father john fairbanks was troubled he retreated to the confessional to think and to pray before settling himself he took out the narrow purple stole he wore when hearing confession it was a vestige of rank dating back to ancient rome and adopted by the church as a symbol of priestly duty he had always worn it with pride to the day before he kissed it and slipped it around his neck he paused unsure holding the thin silk fabric in his hand he fingered it with purpose as if he wasn't quite ready to wear this badge of honor as if he had something to work out before he could fairbanks leaned into the backrest and closed his eyes he might have dozed if it weren't for his nagging conscience it chased sleep ground away at his piece and left only the tattered relics of despair and challenged his faith as he sifted between right and wrong he pleaded for a measure of clemency for acts resulting from the weaknesses of youthful lust and flawed reasoning he begged for compassion not forged in the fires of justice but tempered by the spirit of mercy he was so deep in thought that the steady beeping of his watch alarm startled him he was amazed at how far and long he had rambled among the cherished memories of his teaching days at st augustine's and time spent with the boys his boys the ones he had influenced the ones he had loved boys who had matured into man is it for so soon he thought time like the persistent forward march of the minute hand was running out in the end it was time not his priestly vows nor his allegiance to anyone or thing that pressed his decision the old man sighed not in relief as if he were putting down a bird then rather in the strain of exertion as if he were hoisting it up high exposing it's ugliness for all to see it's time he said aloud as if hearing the words could seal his resolve i'll phone my boys today after confessions then i'll call the bishop then the police fairbanks lifted the stall slipped it over his head and settled it on his show shoulders this simple act symbolized to no one other than himself that he accepted the yoke of duty what had to be done rested with him alone he flipped the switch on the wall and the light outside above his door blinked to life signaling to anyone waiting that he was ready to hear and forgive them since more than any other time in his life he yearned to offer solace to others who like him were troubled as if on cue a shaft of late afternoon sunlight sliced down from the stained glass window sat high on the wall opposite the booth it's rays illuminated the confessional as if it had taken centre-stage the figure who was moving toward the door suddenly edged back into the shadows and waited for for the light to slide away into darkness,0
B07PTC4X54,its executives love roger dawson for his ability to teach their people how to improve profits and make more sales with his power negotiating tactics meeting planners love roger dawson for his ability to put on a terrific presentation that is custom tailored to their audiences and filled with content and humor he is a full time speaker and author and travels around the world giving seminars to corporations and associations in this series of classic segments that follow you'll also discover why roger dawson is truly a cherished treasure among so many people worldwide the segments that follow range in time from nineteen eighty five all the way to two thousand and three so we ask you to forgive any dated references or changes in audio quality our goal was to bring you all the classic segments in their original form form which have been inspiring customers for decades in this first volume of our library we begin with a topic that as i suggested earlier really defined roger's career and was at the center of his expertise negotiating you'll hear segments that cover rogers' overall philosophy of win-win negotiating the three stages of negotiating and several of roger's most well known gambits applicable to everything from negotiating a major business deal to getting a great deal on your next car after listening to this volume you'll agree with roger that indeed life is a series of negocio the asians so now the nightingale conant corporation is very pleased to present the ultimate roger dawson library hello this is roger johnson i wrote the book on negotiating it's cod you can get anything you want but you've got to do more than ask and you really can get anything you want if you just realize these five things number one are negotiating all the time negotiating is not just for prison wardens or f b i agents or union negotiators anytime your eyeball to eyeball bellybutton the belly button kneecap the kneecap toe-to-toe with another human being you and negotiating and if you know how to do it right if you know how to structure a negotiation so that the other people get what they want want but at the same time you get what you want not only will you be a lot more successful in life but a lot of the pressure and the stress on the friction will go out of your life number two is the realization that anything you'll ever want in life is presently owned or controlled by somebody else now this is not eighteen forty nine where you could buy a sluice box down at the hardware store and head for the hills of california and pick up gold and become wealthy because it is laying out there everything he is presently owned or controlled by somebody else and doesn't it make sense that we spent a little time learning how to get it and how to get it in such a way that we're not dominating people we're not turning people off but we're turning people on to us because we know how to get them what they want at the same time as we get what we want so we should all be spending an awful lot of time studying negotiating yet it's amazing to me how few people have my daughter julia graduated from u s c she graduated from the business school one of the finest business schools in the country in fact but she didn't get one hour of negotiating training and so she came away from it feeling that business had to do with reading spreadsheets and profit and loss statements and the mechanics of running a business and once you'll find out is what every businessman has found out that the answer to good business is not in the mechanics but the answer is in handling people in negotiating with employees and suppliers and customers the art of negotiating so critical to you getting what you want number three is the understanding that there are some predictable responses to the maneuvers that take place in a negotiating situation i call these maneuvers gambits and that's a chess time it means any maneuver for advantage for example whenever you say yes to the first offer you set up a predictable route response lemme have you tell me what those responses are let's say for example that you're interested in acquiring a used automobile and the people are asking ten thousand dollars for the car which is not a bad price but you say to yourself while i am going to be a sneaky negotiator i'm going to make them a super low offer i'm going to take them off of seven thousand dollars and sure they're going to get angry,1

B0057AAPKS,the upside however in one that has sparked a renewed sense of desire within companies and i daresay throughout the entire sales profession it turns out that the same people who are hungry for business are also eager for new perspective and creative ideas about what they can do differently to give themselves a competitive advantage never before have individual salespeople been so willing to put their egos aside and adjust our approach to make themselves invaluable to their company and their customers frankly most salespeople are smart enough to realize that some adjustments are necessary with regard to how we approach and deal with clients as it now appears that our best opportunity to get out of the current predicament is going to be to somehow sell our way out companies have experienced a bit of a come up and says well where much of the typical squabbling and internal politics that have traditionally plagued organizations has been replaced by an all hands on deck mentality essentially the same perfect storm that recently stirred up so much dust in the marketplace has also fostered a perfect opportunity to recalibrate the traditional selling mindset updating the effectiveness of your sales force doesn't have to be as daunting as it sounds however it's true that some corporate training departments will need to shift the traditional focus away from continually redefining the sales process or just offering a slew of refresher courses that teach old school content teaching salespeople to sound the same as your closest competitors is an exercise in futility and anything that merits the title of refresher course is more likely to send people backward in their thinking rather than forward does anyone know else think it's strange that the effectiveness of the sales organization drives the success of every company yet the skills required to be successful in a sales role continue to be the least taught professional discipline in the world most companies rely on individual salespeople to figure it out for themselves while some of the more experienced sellers on your team have like the attended a bunch of sales seminars over the years teaching people how to sell in a tough economic climate is very different from what most sellers have encountered from their previous sales training experiences emphasis on sales effectiveness who should be held responsible for the recent softness in sales volume unfortunately finger pointing to assign blame has become a veritable pastime in some companies and industries however in sales after you get done blaming the economy blaming corporate marketing or blaming the competition and sometimes even blaming the cusp zimmer if you look around any sales organization you will notice that some salespeople are significantly more effective than others even though they are selling the same basic products and services to the same types of customers what is it that makes a top performing sales person more effective than one of their struggling counterparts what is it exactly that they are doing to separate themselves from the competition in a way that overcomes the adversities and grievances many other shells people see as obstacles it's a fair question but very few people have the answer i wrote this book with the intentional and unmistakable mission to increase the sales effectiveness of the person staring back at you when you look in them mirror it is possible that the techniques and strategies outlined in this book can also help your colleagues business partners and maybe even your management team let's consider that a bonus if it happens but the truth of the matter is if you aspire to become a more effective salesperson the time has come for you to take matters into your own hands the customer's impression of you will enable or compromise the entire business relationship unfortunately this topic of individual effectiveness has been pushed to the back burner for too long and in the process lots of good people have been caught off guard and in some cases are unprepared for how best to respond given the rapidly changing business environment if it is indeed true that some salespeople in your industry are more effective than others then i encourage you to bring your own personal selling effectiveness back to the forefront in order to give yourself the strongest possible opportunity to be perceived as a valuable resource by your company your colleagues and your customers while it's true that you still have to position your company and products in their best light to be effective in today's economic climate you must learn how to sell yourself first introduction the game has changed do you realize that in the state of georgia where i live you have to have a license to catch a fish or own a dog but you can refer to yourself as a sales professional without any credentials whatsoever it's true even though the sales industry will pay probably

B07SBKTMQH,i didn't plan to be a teacher i was going to be a photographic journalist and live in a loft in new york city and travel the world somewhere in my turbulent undergraduate years i declared a teaching major instead a love of reading books was transferred to a love of learning and prague gress once i decided to become a teacher it's just easier to say i went into it because of a love of english i was doctor snack cakes to my college friends with awareness that earning a doctorate in english was a distant dream first i would teach we get many first days and teaching was my first day as a substitute the very first in inner city flint i turned a lesson on math into sharing my box of cheez-its because the kindergarteners told me they were hungry or was my first day when i taught a semester of english in the evenings at marcos de nisa high school in tempe i didn't have my own classroom and it wasn't particularly memorable my next first day was also my last at marcos i replace to substitute in the tempe summer school program after the first day of class and was eager to try the workshop approach we went to the library and students picked out a book to read silently for thirty minutes we saw add in a circle and everyone shared what they read about and learned two of the kids had selected children's books and acted foolish while an administrator observed class she explained that at summer school there just isn't time because the curriculum is to be covered in halftime she was kind and found me a position in the office for the summer while i waited for the chance to implement a workshop approach again two months later august of nineteen ninety one in maricopa arizona felt like the official start of my career maricopa is a rural school district with three school buildings all sitting on one desolate plot of land in the desert to competing bars with crowded parking lots and a rundown grocery store where all that stood out when driving on the highway through town unless you saw the herd of wild horses those were inexperienced more memorable than many of the students who sat in my first classroom i was the middle school reading teacher i began my first day that year in the same way i began every day for the rest of the year trying to figure out how to keep thirty seventh graders under control for fifty minutes when they had nothing to do first hour was study hall classes b began at eight a m and i watched the clock and waited for eight fifty a m like a caged wolf watching bambi in the field my management technique has always boiled down to keeping students actively engaged and learning with no lessons to teach my lack of preparation for classroom management i was glaring despite first hour and some of the worst moments in my teaching career i persisted and grew in my first position as a full-time teacher,0
B07DM7X9XX,we all know that revenue comes from customers the problem is customers are independent minded they don't necessarily do what you want them to do you do everything that you think should work but the results are discouraging you get fewer responses than you thought you would those who do respond bond give you hope you try to make the sale but all too often they don't buy you're left wondering what to do you read blogs and business books attend webinars and seminars and hire consultants you have numerous meetings with your trusted partners you try one marketing and selling method after another consuming precious capital and time trying to get potential customers to buy but the revenue needle doesn't move why not because the answer isn't in the places you've been looking your customers are the only ones who know the real answers they will tell you willingly what they want from you and how they want to buy it but only if you ask them properly in the right way at the right time don't bother asking when you're selling to them nobody tells you what they're really thinking when you're selling to them don't depend on surveys or focus groups both methods have inherent bound to mislead you flaws when you're trying to find out what your customers want and how they want to buy nor will social media provide this critical information social media certainly gives you away to see what customers are saying about you and you can build branded platforms that give your customers and fans a place to converse with each other such as your own facebook fan page or a community discussion review section on your site the information you gather from watching online disc russians tends to be situation specific limited to the context of things your company is doing while i do think social media is massively changing how companies interact with customers and the very nature of marketing it is not the most efficient way to uncover the real reasons someone would or would not buy your product or service what drove them to you in the first place and the process they went through as they made the purchase even social media companies hire me to interview their clients so they can obtain information about perceptions preferences and the buying process in this book i will teach you how to ask customers correctly in the right way at the right time once you have asked them correctly and they have told you what you need to know i will show you how to use that knowledge to change your marketing strategy and the culture of your company from company centred to customer centric when you become customer centric you will develop products and services and positioning strategies that appeal to your customers and differentiate you from your competition you will fix the things that are counterproductive and costing you sales your people processes and systems will be redirected from selling pushing customers to buy by to making it easy for customers to buy what they already want it will be easier for customers to understand what you sell buy it from you and tell others about their delightful experience your company will become responsive to customers to the point where customers will see you as the go-to source for exactly what they need need at this moment someone is on your website reading copy that doesn't help him while looking for answers that he cannot find another prospective customer has decided she won't buy from you because of something disconcerting that your sales person has just sat on the phone in each case these customers came to you fully intending to me a purchase and would have been happy to buy from you but something stopped them something they read or heard or couldn't find put them off using the methods in this book you will be able to determine exactly when the customer decides that he isn't going to buy from you and why once you know what is keeping your customers from buying and what they need to happily make a purchase the solutions become obvious fortunately the required solutions rarely require a major restructuring the necessary changes are usually straightforward and not that difficult to make it's just a matter of knowing what needs to be improved and then making those improvements intelligently as a revenue coach i spend every working day helping ceos and entrepreneurs increase their revenue by selling what their customers want and making it easy for customers to buy i help them reverse engineer their successful sales so they can manufacture new sales in quantity,1
B00D9BQOZW,who do they gotta be careful you don't want to get your you don't want to go around committing towards are you going to you're going to get hit with a lot of liability so how do you avoid that first we're going to start with the foundations of tort law where tort comes from what it's talking about now the eveleigh mission of tort law includes two key concepts the a duty which is breached and a legally protected interest so for you to be liable for a tort you must first have breached a duty on what sort of a duty for this duty come from well that's not always well defined which will go into but you're only liable if you're subject to some duty that you failed now all of us are given a duty of behaving like the reasonable person that used to be a reasonable man now it's a reasonable person all of us have to behave like a reasonable person as we go through our lives and if we behave unreasonably and hurt someone we've breached that duty to be a reasonable person but the duties are better defined in some areas some people have higher duties clearly a doctor has a higher duty of care than a an ordinary person who's trying to resuscitate you other other cases there are no duties there generally is no duty to rescue people unless you produced a situation which required the rescue will talk about specific duties later but know that you're not liable in tort law unless you have breached some duty the second concept key to tort law is that of the legally protected interest that is a legally protected interest even if you breach a duty you're only liable if you have violated someone's legally protected interest well what are legally pr detective interests wells many of the legally protected interests of the one you might assume physical well being few breach of duty and you hurt me take my hand off or something you've violated a legally protected interest but not all harms are legally protected interest and some of the greatest harms are not legally protected interests what if someone behaves terribly thoughtlessly toward you and causes you a b broken heart well your broken heart might hurt more than a broken finger but you can sue for the broken finger you can't sue for the broken heart the law doesn't want to get into that you can't sue someone for negligently failing to return your phone calls you can't even sue them for intentionally failing to return your phone calls hurt feelings as a rule are not illegally protests the interest that the law is concerned with maybe it should be maybe this shows the paternalism of the law i don't know but it's not it's not illegal or protect interests so don't try suing somebody for a broken heart likewise you can't sue somebody for a variety of forms of of you know emotional distress you might suffer i mean suppose you sit down in a class and you're sitting straight across the room from someone and this person is really awful looking to you you know you'd think this person is so ugly and you have to look at them everyday because you have this assigned seat in class you have to sit there everyday to look at that person every day and you can't bear it and you have nightmares ah this person is so appalling as part of the zola i can't take it can you sue that person for that now you can't can't sue somebody for just looking the way they look even if that causes you great emotional harm now if they were shooting spitballs at you that would be another matter but okay that's that's the basics of tort breach of duty and a legally protected interest now i want to talk about the categories of tort as we go into more background about tort law there are three main categories of torts and they evolved in pretty much the sort under first the intentional torts second torts of negligence and third some cases where there is strict liability which means you're automatically liable for the harm you cause even if you haven't breached a duty really let's start with intentional intentional tort or where you take inaction on purpose and cause harm to another person thereby injuring them an action taken on purpose and there's an old phrase here that that even a dog knows the difference between being kicked and being tripped over well that's the difference between an intentional tort being kicked and unintentional tort being tripped over now you think intel might be might be an easy matter whether someone did it intentionally or not but it's not always easy because sometimes someone,1

B00JTZP29G,while it's true that salespeople must have a great understanding of their product one must not forget that no matter what you're selling you're in the people business it's people who buy those products that's why it is vital that sales people know about people first products second i've known salespeople ruin understood every in and out of the product they knew every detail but were unable to close the deal as they have an inferior disabling understanding of people being superior product knowledge and yet inferior regarding people knowledge equals minimal results understanding the product before you understand people is like putting the cart if you will in front of the horse it won't go anywhere realize right now you're in the people business first and the product business second,1
B07KX4XDM4,then we must first ask and more important answer some questions how does profiling assist and add value to investigations what key aspects of an offender profile should be included in the profiling and are such details as marital status age and race really necessary as well as fraudster background skill and professional qualifications would it be beneficial to include in such profiling the characteristics of the fraud scheme or scenario itself and the situation that lends itself to the fraud furthermore should the type of victim organization be analyzed and should this be further drilled down into as to which departments and divisions are more prone to fraud attack many surveys tell us that eighty to eighty five per cent of fraud is committed by insiders surely if we knew from which departments the fraudsters emanate or possibly more important which vulnerable departments they try to be read recruited in then this could be a focal area for both proactive fraud risk management and reactive investigation we all too often focus on the control environment and quite often human beings are fundamental to that control environment or at least key elements of it human beings are the weakest link how strong is the control in a segregation of duties if the employees in the process exhibit characteristics that place their honesty and integrity in doubt surely if the human element of the control environment is not considered then such controls are weak or even nonexistent profiling of the these employees is fundamental to an effective control environment there is no doubt however that a full understanding of what fraud is and which measures are best suited to combating the fraud disease is absolutely necessary before we can start to profile the fraudster or his actions we have to face the f fact that fraud cannot be prevented internal controls and security systems reduce the risk but there are no guarantees and the track record of prevention and detection is actually not great humans can be ingenious and their behavior unpredictable some are desperate many are merely risk-takers most are both some employees may have a lot more devious entrepreneurial spirit than we may have imagined if fraud is committed by trusted employees who know the system then it is quite likely that they also know how to bypass these controls and therefore something more is required in the preventive and detective fight fraud profiling is the process of identifying the characteristics that the fraudster and his fraud would present or be visualized if that fraud were to happen in your organization if you know what it looks like you can identify or recognize it and catch it when it happens if you catch it when it happens it will make the next person think twice about committing fraud and will leave investigators with key indicators of the behavioral or situational patterns or footprints for the future interestingly as is the case at the time of writing in periods of economic slowed down or recession the likelihood of employee fraud increases apart from the increase in financial need there is also increased psychological pressure on employees employees tend to not only be under greater personal financial stress currently but may also be under greater personal insecurity about their future in the organization when close colleagues are laid off fear and insecurity prevail psychologically this brings about a further dimension to the profiling scenario the fact that the economic environment should be included as a constituent part of profiling fraudsters put simply human beings in a deprived part of a city in a country going through economic slowdown might be more apt to commit fraud than those earning good salaries in a country that is booming or bypassing recession the economic environment therefore also needs to be included in any profiling methodology in summary fraud happens it happens in any organization that has money or assets irrespective of profitability quite often it is a cause of an organization not being profitable the fraudster is internal remember eighty to eighty five percent of fraud is committed by persons inside the organization by our colleagues who are more often than not at a senior level and to whom we report and upon whom we rely to safeguard the assets of our business we have to adopt the attitude that the fraudster is within our organization and therefore it is only prudent that we alter,1

B07658Y8GM,in the atrocious throw donegan refers to the leader as vidic issue meaning one who wants to be victorious and conquer in spite of the challenges even today a leader has to think like a conqueror and succeed irrespective of the circumstances leadership as a concept has been evolving over the centuries leader initially referred to the king of a country or nation today we have leaders in every field politics business science academics administration armed forces society community various unions sports teams and even spirituality some leaders may have a large following others may not some leaders are great readers and public speakers while others sit quietly at their desks or laboratories and become thought leaders they give a new direction and perspective to the way people think some leaders are immensely popular when they are alive their work attain speed and recognition in that generation other leaders are celebrated after they're dead because they were much ahead of their times and their generation could not understand their greatness some leaders such as look manya tilak rabindranath tagore or the revolver are known in their particular reagents in the village a community or a nation others like mahatma gandhi napoleon albert einstein or abraham lincoln gain worldwide recognition yet all these leaders have something in common some factors that earn them respect and appreciation which we also call attributes of leadership so what exactly is leadership across the globe leadership has become a subject of serious discussion study and research universities now have centres of leadership the number of books written on leadership has been growing rapidly,1
B06XR5KV72,it happens in my opinion to be a bloody good one sudden and rapturous applause from the audience but haven't smiled modestly allowing the noise to run it's course and held up an arresting hand as it began to die then he spoke in rich and measured tones remember please that all of us here are on the same side side in this no one respects our policemen and police women more than i do all of us sleep more easily in our beds each night because of their actions when occasional evidence of corruption or rank inefficiency is exposed i am the first person to say that this represents the exception rather than the rule i am sure the audience will agree with me when i say that we are lucky to have men like detective sergeant hook working on our behalf the applause this time was more sporadic and uncertain as if the clappers were anxious to recognize his very worthy sentiments rather than support the integrity of the nation's police force literary parallels flooded unbidden and unhelpful into bert hook surprisingly fertile mind they were not helpful to him he felt not like hamlet dominating the danish court but like woodhouse is gassy think nuttall thrust onto the stage to present prizes he said sternly mr jackson and mr above and quite right they present crime fiction not real key crime and they do so highly successfully oh i'm not here to criticize them the presenter leapt upon this like a hungry lion upon raw meat oh but you are dea's hook that is exactly why you are here because unless the adventures presented to us under the mantle of detective chief inspector launched and have some convincing basis in fact they will not be able to carry the credibility which the public domain man's reality is unnecessary background a stage setting if you will to the mysteries which are so entertaining lie unravelled forests upon the nation's tv screens each wednesday evening hoke didn't want to get involved in the errors of detail in the series he sends that would lead him into arguments he couldn't win he smiled as blandly as he could and said the public doesn't always demand realism the james bond films have been one of the great commercial successes of the modern set lamar no one really believes that spies and secret agents behave as the central character in the series does it was not the presenter but sam jackson who replied to this he said wistfully he got lots of naked flesh in a bond films that makes people less critical a scream fell with curvy female ass dulls the critical faculties that last bit was worthy of the great goal when himself sam thought modesty had never been a troublesome virtue to him his sentiment brought a delighted roar from the audience part hilarity and part shock at his directness at this hour of the day his use of the american ass seemed somehow more shocking than it's british equivalent the presenter wriggled uncomfortably a warning from his produces shredding in his earphone he needed to shut up jackson who was waving his cigar and threatening further indiscretions i think everyone accepts that the bomb films are high spirited romps but somehow one expects tv crime series to have a more solid basis in fact the stories are of course fictional but one expects inspector loxton as the central character to be convince dancing as a british policeman margin bottom and as the man who has played this role now for several years would you not agree with me on this oh indeed i would james always memorize the name of your interviewer and use it as frequently as you can without groveling but if it was by now a veteran of tv interviews as well as a popular actor in a hit series one of the first things i did when i was offered the part of ben loxton six years ago was to attend my local police station and immerse myself in police procedure for two whole days it increased my respect for or the police service may i say again that our police officers male and female do a wonderful job in circumstances which are often trying more drawing than those presented in the inspector,0
B07MQ29JYT,the white ladders welcome to new york stretching across a red wall inside the busy airport send my heart into a wild staccato beat my breasts become tight like there's plastic wrap sealing my mouth i'm actually doing this ne farmer's daughter has lived on an acreage in nowhere ville minnesota her whole life if i lost my freaking mind after collecting my luggage i stopped to ask a third person where i can find the spot i was told to wait for my ride as the first two directions i received as clear as mud it's intimidating to be surrounded by hundreds of people and have literally no one i can easily relate to but for twenty two years i've been a big city girl at heart stuck in a small town for as long as i can remember i've dreamed of moving to new york the idea seemed ludicrous until two years ago when i met charlo the online friend of a a friend who posted something about living in brooklyn i messaged her and we chatted non-stop clicking like we had known each other our whole lives enchanted by someone who had lived in big cities all her life i was eager to live vicariously through my new world traveling friend before long sharla was begging me to move into her apartment and i was finding ways to convince my dad and crazy possessive brothers that the farm could operate without me that in itself was no easy feat but i had to scrape my life savings together to make it work before my mom died she would always say that i was a unique soul meant for great things i just hope my unique soul has finally found a place to fit in because there's already a slow and he is trickling in making me wonder if i've made a mistake only a handful of minutes pass where i stand alone beneath a well lit canopy in the cool summer night before a new honda pulled in at the curb honking madly with the side of my friend racing out of her car my nerves even out in a swell of excitement burns through my chest this is finally happy running it's surreal to see charlotte one person even though she doesn't look any different from all our video chats and a loose fitting shirt and geometric designs paired with bright orange capri leggings it's just the kind of thing i would picture her wearing a centric jewelry covers her wrists fills multiple holes in her ear rs and hangs from her neck the braid crossing above her forehead is so charlo the free spirited friend i've come to adore who could possibly make an adventure out of brushing her teeth a sophisticated aura surrounds my friend that goes beyond her bohemian wardrobe the lilt of her voice and the sharp slant of her pierce knows she's exotic and charismatic able to lighten up a room just by entering beyond being roughly the same height or physical characteristics couldn't be any more different she is blonde haired blue eyed and has a healthy booty that must bring boys running to her yard even without the aid of a milkshake but she's skinny and all the other places where i could stand to lose a few pounds and her luscious hair flows down to her elbows though i've seen the colorful half sleep of flowers and print covering her right arm i see the large tattoo on her foot for the first time wonder where the other eight are hidden jumping up and down i squeal as she makes her way around her car and launches herself into my arms pike lord i feel like we've been waiting an eternity for this moment sharla declares stepping backward and lacing our fingers together just as bloody gorgeous then person as i pictured you addressed your flight went well it was fine i answer shrugging then another wave of excitement hits me you're gorgeous too i can't believe we're finally meeting after all this time is brilliant her i shift the two large suitcases on the sidewalk behind me those both yours i couldn't decide what i wanted now and what i wanted to mail i admit sheepishly i was up until two in the morning repacking when i second guessed my choices worried i'd look like a country bumpkin waitressing at the local bar and working for my dad didn't allow the kind of money it would take to move out here and buy a new wardrobe so i had to make do with what i have come on then let's load the map and we'll grab something to eat at my flat eyes wide she slaps her hands over her mouth i mean all flood bloody hell it's going to take some time for that to settle in my noggin,0
B079TBRNVX,do this the sooner we'll succeed let's look at the specific areas in which you'll want to see yourself operating successfully as preparation for selling preparing for success one set your overall goal to break the goal into daily work segments three carry out these daily segments for gain prospective customers five spend time on critical activities six create self management systems charts and seven organize work systems set your overall goal start at the top of the list and set your goals what do you want to achieve calculated in some specific terms will it be a monetary figure a percentage or multiple of a target set by your company a possession to be acquired or even a promotion now think about how to convert that goal to the actual number of sales you need in order to achieve your target get now the next step is critical and this is the step most unsuccessful sales people avoid divide your total sales into weekly and daily sales and then calculate the work necessary to achieve that calculate workload ask yourself the following questions about workload how many sales do i want how many prospects will i need to see in order to make one sale how many prospects do i need in order to reach my total sales target how many activities do i need to do to generate one prospect telephone calls direct mail or emailed letters exhibitions or seminars advertisements cold calling and other and what daily activity schedule and results do i have to maintain in order to achieve my goal include visits telephone calls and all of the above self deception bob adams one of the world's top insurance salesmen puts it in strong terms he says that the single biggest failure salespeople make is self deception he said he wasn't born with success he had to study the most successful salespeople he could find his advice don't fool yourself into thinking you're selling when you're sitting at your desk if you're not in front of the right number of people every day working eight hours per day is not the point it's what you do in those eight hours that counts if you're not in front of enough prospects you won't sell enough to make your target and how'd you get in front of enough prospects by making enough appointments it's that straightforward yet many people fool themselves thinking they're selling when in fact they are doing busy work says bob here's a tip often the difference between success and failure is neglecting to break down your overall goal into daily targets and tasks let's look at advice from people who succeed year after year how do they put this principle into practice one salesman with a worldwide reputation for success is over from sweden he has calculated his yearly target and broken it down into a daily figure he knows exactly how many sales he must make eight per day he knows how many prospects he must see each day he stresses that staying at the top is easy if you know how much you must do every day and you do it not me oh daily targets don't relate to me many people argue that's the biggest misconception i hear from our seminar delegates they really believe they can't break their activity into daily targets this is the first mental change we must all make if we are to succeed in selling here's a tip sales come about from methodically carrying out the right practices day in and day out whether we sell large systems to governments that require three years to close consulting projects that take a year to close or retail products to customers that take three minutes to close we still have to calculate which daily component parts will lead us to success even if we only want three customers per year we i'll have to be negotiating with six nine or twelve prospects constantly we need to know how many and keep this running constantly in the interviews,1

B011S86P6U,chapter six getting paid the most important chapter in the training manual nothing left to chance i was extremely fortunate to have been taught the consultancy ropes by a seasoned professional seamus all work knew and taught me from day one just how difficult it can be to actually earn big fees from cancer valency i don't mean do the work i mean actually getting paid a fair and honest fee for what has been done i have worked both sides of the atlantic and both hemispheres of the globe it is no easier in the usa or down under than it is here most consultants simply do not make the grade my prodigies invariably do and that a sip early because of the way they are trained seamus laid it out on the line to me in no uncertain terms nothing was left to chance our whole operation thought process pitch and modus operandi was geared to us getting paid qualify the client from the moment seamus or i opened the dialogue with potential clients on the phone we were gathering intelligence not only about the person and the business we were dealing with but one of our main thoughts was how we were going to get paid who was going to pay us and who was going to stand in the way of us getting paid in our business we were turnaround wizards and of course many of the questions we asked were of a financial nature huh has your cash flow dried up completely do you take checks cash visa and mastercard what is the best week you have ever had what is the worst week you have ever had then the questions would revolve around who are the principals is this a one man band are their partners silent or working was there a spouse involved in any key capacity whatsoever who signs the checks are there professional advisers involved what advice had already been given if any by accountants and lawyers in this line of questioning we would get to the bottom of whether the client could pay us and wanted to pay us or if someone was lurking in the background who may prevent this from happening we wanted to know exactly what we were dealing with and then work out a strategy to ensure success all the time we would be driving deeper and trying to build a picture of the clients' problems however we were also trying desperately hard to get to the bottom of whether we were going to pick up fees or risk going on a wild goose chase as seamus said a hiding to nothing it was this brutal yet careful methodology of gathering intelligence that allowed us to get paid one hundred percent of the time i must add that this intelligence gathering was done in a very friendly sensitive and conversational manner the client would think we were just getting company background which was true and essential to to a degree but we also had to figure out whether this client had the wherewithal and the aptitude to pay us now wishes that we've all been waiting for this really is the most important chapter in the book getting paid that's what he's all about this is a license to print money this business but unless you know what you're doing being you will not get paid and as i mentioned previously i do know consultants out there who are not really coining it on biking huge big fat phase i don't i don't want you to be one of them i want you to be one of my success stories and not only do i want you to get paid i want you to earn big fat face i'm going to share with you a few things you've got a concentrate of course on giving value added you gotta help your clients make money or solve their problems find a need and fill it helped them expand help them take over companies expand their vision not massively increase their confidence massively show them things that they don't know how to do take them to the moon and back this is absolutely crucial now if you're going to do a good job you're going to get paid but i i want to explain something to you getting paid is not why new sci outfit she's going to cost you three grind five grind fifty grand one hundred grind at that moment in time the sale and the amount of money begins why why why e-bike wine right so let me give you a few examples of what's happened to me over the years i remember getting off a plane in warsaw in poland on a guy met me there he knew i was coming into the country mr holler and he spoke very good english he didn't have an interpreter mr hollande this is how he opened the sentence i know i've got to pay you but i really do need help with this what every was in actual fact it was a hologram company in poland i need some help with face paying you is not a problem i know there is phase involved wang can we start i'm here now let's go i remember getting off of a plane in sydney australia nava guy by me obviously this was an internal flight,1
B07RBRV5FS,the knowledge economy grew for decades and was ultimately accelerated as computers and the internet became available this changing economic landscape had many effects but among the most significant was a change in how employees created value would work though this rise of knowledge work which management guru peter drucker first described in nineteen fifty nine as a shift to creating value with your mind instead of your muscle further reinforced the need for a new approach to management for the first time the employee's ability to be creative problem solve and process information had become a core part of how the employee produced work output as a result the following decades represented an expansion of efforts both in academia and in business to better understand work and employee mode novation this included studies of goal setting intrinsic motivation and job satisfaction in nineteen ninety william kahn at boston university published a research paper in which he is credited for coining the term employee engagement since the then the concept of employee engagement has increasingly represented the quest to create workplaces that fully embody the ideas of theory why that mcgregor imagined so many decades ago,1
B012BDN5TG,differently they think ahead toward their long term goals decide which fight to avoid and which are inevitable know how to control and channel their emotions when forced to fight they do so with indirection and subtle maneuver making their manipulations hard to trace in this way they can maintain the peaceful exterior so cherished in these political times this ideal of fighting rationally comes to us from organized warfare where the art of strategy was invented and refined in the beginning war was not at all strategic battles between tribes were fought in a brutal manner a kind of ritual of violence in which individuals could display their heroism but as tribes expanded and evolved into states it became all too apparent that war had too many hidden costs that waging it blindly often lead to exhaustion and self destruction even for the victor somehow wars had to be fought more rationally the word strategy comes from the ancient greek word strata ghosts meaning literally the leader of the army strategy in this sense was the art of generalship of commanding the entire war effort deciding what formations to deploy what terrain to fight on what maneuvers to use to gain an edge and as this knowledge progressed military leaders discovered that the more they thought and planned ahead the more possibilities they had for success novel strategies could allow them to defeat much larger armies as alexander the great did in his victories over the persians in facing savvy opponents who were also using strategy there developed an upward pressure to gain an advantage a general had to be even more strategic more indirect and clever than the other side over time the arts of generalship became steadily more sophisticated as more strategies were invented although the word strategy itself is greek in origin the concept appears in all cultures in all periods solid principles on how to deal with the inevitable accidents of war how to craft the ultimate plan how to best organize the army all of this can be found in war manuals from ancient china to modern europe the counter attack the flanking or enveloping maneuver and the arts of deception are common to the armies of genghis khan napoleon and the zulu king shaka as a whole these principles and strategies indicate a kind of universal military wisdom a set of adaptable patterns that can increase the chances for victory perhaps the greatest strategist of all western zhou author of the ancient chinese classic the art of war in his book written probably in the fourth century b c can be found traces of almost all the strategic patterns and principles later developed over the course of centuries but what connects them in fact what constitutes the art of war itself and sons whose eyes is the ideal of winning without bloodshed by playing on the psychological weaknesses of the opponent by maneuvering him into precarious positions by inducing feelings of frustration and confusion a strategist can get the other side to break down mentally before so surrendering physically in this way victory can be had at a much lower cost and the state that wins wars with few lives lost and resources squandered is the state that contrive over greater periods of time certainly most wars are not waged so rationally but those campaigns in history that have followed this principle scipio africanus in spain napoleon at uhm t e lawrence in the desert campaigns of world war one stand out above the rest and serve as the ideal war is not some separate realm divorced from the rest of society it is an eminently human arena full of the best and the worst of our nature war also reflects trends in society the evolution toward more unconventional dirtier strategies guerrilla warfare terror tourism mirrors a similar evolution in society where almost anything goes the strategies that succeed in war whether conventional or unconventional are based on timeless psychology and great military failures have much to teach us about human stupidity and the limits of force in any arena the strategic ideal in war being supremely rational and emotionally balanced striving to win with minimum bloodshed and loss of resources has infinite application and relevance to our daily battles inculcated with the values of our times many will argue that organized war isn't,1
B00SZABT9I,i could tell the minute i woke up that it was sunday for one thing it was daylight and the alarm wasn't shrieking but mostly because the songs of the birds and the september breezes coming through my open window had that sunday morning sound and feel to them i rolled over and snuggled up against rick's warm body eh that's when it hit me rick and i were getting a divorce there shouldn't be a man in my bed i sat bolt upright heart pounding who the hell was sleeping in my bed good looking dark golden hair straight from the sun and lady clairol nice tan and complacent expression even when he was asleep eric i suppressed a groan as i came fully awake and remembered his unexpected appearance on my front porch and everything that followed the night before i had clearly lost my mind not that my mind ever had much control where rick was concerned when i opened the door to see him standing there yesterday evening feet hp planted firmly on my doormat with it's image of taz shrieking in bright red letters go away i'd been glad to see him right then i should have called nine one one to request that i be declared mentally incompetent and hauled off in chains for my own protection i couldn't possibly be glad to see rick when i knew he'd already moved mfi or buffy or whatever her name was into our house and our bed instead i just stood there looking at him and he looked back at me with those eyes that were bluer than the kansas city sky in the middle of summer of course if that's guy wore tinted contacts it could be that blue too i did huh have enough presence of mind to snarl at him what do you want i attempted to sneer he smiled the smile that made him top salesman at reims commercial real estate for the past six years somebody at a party once asked greg what he sold he gave the person that same smile and said myself and he did a damned good job of it so i snarled and sneered and he smiled i knew he wanted to sell me something probably himself hi babe he said and waved a manila envelope we made to go over some more terms as of the settlement agreement so i thought i'd stop by in-person yeah right i knew and he knew that i knew there were no more terms of the divorce to go over he demanded the lion's share and i'd agreed because all i wanted was for the whole thing to be finished i was asking for four things this house not the big one where he and mavi buffet lived but their small one that used to be one of our rental properties the rental house next door where my friend paula lived my coffee lunch dessert shop death by chocolate and my old but fast red toyota celica however i'd been facing another saturday night alone loan with a book or playing scrabble with paula and it was one of those evenings when it's not summer anymore but not yet fall the air was still warm though it had a nostalgic feel to it as if remembering all the fun of the summer slowly fading into the past and dreading the cold winter on it's way or maybe that was just how how i was feeling nanny way i asked rick an and when i wasn't looking he ordered a pizza double pepperoni my favorite kind and like i said he's a damned good salesman one dumb thing led to another and then another and now here he was sleeping in my bed i slid out very carefully trying not to wake him i needed some caffeine and sugar pumping through my veins before i could deal with his inevitable leaving again every time was like another knife straight to the god a dull rusty serrated knife the kind i should take to his throat right now or maybe some portion of his anatomy a bit lower nah he had just bleed all over my new shades and i'd have to clean it up in eight years of marriage he never cleaned up a single one of the messes he made i pulled down the t shirt and cut offs i've been wearing when he came over last night then fastened my unruly red hair into a ponytail moving wildly so i wouldn't wake him as i started out of the room i noticed his cell phone had fallen from his pants pockets the pants he draped over my wooden rocking chair last night i told myself to move on gear out of that room as fast as i could but the phone was blinking and a faint buzzing was coming from it,0
B07FWH51YL,join the worldwide leadership initiative to be successful in the twenty first century requires the organization to meet the challenges of reducing costs while still increasing resources this paradox can be achieved through a previously unrecognized source that is already in your budget the discretionary effort of every individual in the organization when the des question every effort of many individuals is combine it create synergy and can be observed as solutions oriented energy that adds value at each step in the process of providing a product or service to a customer it is untapped potential as it exists naturally within the mind of every employee waiting for an invitation to be released when the invitation is extend good discretionary effort is released as an intentional free will choice by the employee when the gift of discretionary effort is unwrapped it is visible in the efficiency focus and quality of outputs it does not deplete the energy of individuals but it creates a vitality that is hard to duplicate by other means it is the seek crit to doing more with less understanding the ross brand or discretionary effort leadership model is the first step to releasing the gift of discretionary effort available within your organization and adopting twenty first century leadership principles the second step is to implement the principles and create an environment where employees naturally unwrap their character gifts of creativity and productivity by adopting key concepts becoming a human led value organization recognizing the human dignity of each individual to using the power of gratitude and thanking employees for their contributions three encouraging every manager to invest in professional development and become the leader of one can they lead themselves first and display excellence for those around them having a leadership team that demonstrates authentic contribution will create a multiplier effect and help employees achieve emotional commitment and rational alignment so they do the right thing the next right thing and do it in the right way ultimately some employees will be come up that didn't contributors who willingly released their discretionary effort to increase profitability and sustainability in a competitive environment where organizations must continually learn and adapt with a closer connection to customers in the marketplace the organization will be more viable and economically sustainable implementing the five leadership levels and moving organization to a culture of discretionary effort isn't a quick fix it takes some time and energy to create new habits but discretionary effort transforms the culture of your organization to an environment of candid serious discussion and debate and it creates win-win situations it is contagious and the results of your job question during effort leadership initiative will move employees from minimal effort to amazing contributions below is a summary of behaviors you can observe at each level of implementation leadership level one safety and security observable behavior conforming when employees conform to safety rules and regulations and know their company has to it's about security they have a feeling of wellbeing they are free to observe processes and services contemplate how they could be improved and give discretionary effort leadership level to social acceptance observable behavior relating as manager show acceptance of each individual team members interact with each other build professional relate one and collaborate discretionary effort is manifest as they find innovative solutions to daily problems leadership level three rational alignment observable behaviors a lining ensuring that the purpose and goals of the organization are articulated at all levels of the organization enables workers to align their daily work routines with the organizational focus leadership level for emotional commitment observer will behaviors supporting one definition for integrating is to combine parts to produce a whole or a larger unit this is what happens at this level many individual employees decide to stay and help it pursue greatness they become loyal employees leadership level five authentic contribution observer will behavior leading because they are subject matter experts employees who reach this level of contribution lead other employees regardless of their place on the organizational chart they help create synergy of ideas to innovate the twenty first century worldwide leadership initially begins with each manager choo choosing into practice discretionary effort and modeling through personal leadership or the leadership of one as we have called it in this book at each manager practised as the principals and employees follow their example the more the value of discretionary effort will be evident,1

B01GU2AVI2,like any seventeen year old i wanted to move out and have all the fun and adventure that comes with going off to college but would going off with some of my best friends to one of the colleges that would accept me right now be the right choice for me in the long run was the quality of education worth the financial strain my dad is a brilliant man who has a master's degree in engineering but he did not travel conventional educational route in school and thus he never believed in the top school or best philosophy that has only gotten more popular with parents while he would have made it work if it had been my choice he was against me applying to a four year college his idea was that i should live at home save money go to community college and then transfer as practical as this plan seemed i saw this path as a failure compared to others i began to wonder what i would be missing out on and how the mistakes i had already made were going to negatively impact my future that weekend i went over to my friend's house for a party since our parents were out of town everyone was talking about what colleges they were up to and how excited they were there was a paper cut out of a pig with wings dangling from the light fixture over their kitchen table this lewis carroll quote was scrawled on it in pencil the time has come the walrus said to talk of many things of shoes and ships and sealing wax of cabbages and kings and why the sea is boiling hot and whether pigs have wings that poetic gibberish contained a lot of magic for me aside from a talking walrus and a bunch of whimsical nonsense the poems seem to be telling me that it was time for me to believe that pigs could grow eggs that unreasonable fantastic things could in fact happen in that instant i felt a deep sense of hope and realized that i had to stop wondering would i would be missing out on if i didn't have while the paths of my friends i had to believe that my own path starting with community college might be the best thing that ever happened to me i saw clearly that i needed to worry less about how i was failing and wonder more about what i was capable of and about when and what i was going to do about it it was as if in that moment i realized of key course it was not too late to do something bold with my life i was just going to have to come from behind i knew that the path i was choosing for myself was not going to be easy or ordinary but i was going to make it worthwhile that moment i made a decision i was cracking down and turning things around i was going to go to community college seriously bring it and see where that took me i was going to stop playing a victim to my circumstances and seeing my future as a product of my past that was the first of the many times since in my life when i have come to see that whenever i stop focusing on what i don't have in comparison to others and just focus on working hard to deserve what i want i can change my life in the most extraordinary ways turning it around and cracking down so i enrolled in glendale community college in ninety ninety the summer i graduated what was i waiting for i had a lot of catching up and saving up to do i took a full course load and work twenty hours a week waiting tables as well as filing at a law firm those who go straight to a four year school may think community college is not as hard that is not the case some of the teachers i had there like stephen white and economics were better teachers in my opinion than some of the most prestigious professors i had later at stanford there are also those who think community college is full of slackers that is actually only half true classes were a lot less crowded after the first few sessions because some students dropped out many with the excuse that they were too busy or couldn't afford it yet many others remain there proving that getting an education was something so important it can be done alongside putting meals on the table but only with extraordinary effort in those classrooms i met immigrant parents like one father of three who took an eight am econ class rushed out to get to his job as a janitor then went to a second job and finally came back to school for the eight pm accounting class i met many single mothers who worked odd jobs cared for multiple kids and earn their degrees at night i met people who were the utter opposite of slackers and it was an easy competition and especially in glendale during that time the classrooms were filled with adults who had degrees in other countries but were getting re credentialed in the united states my math and science classrooms in particular were filled with armenian doctors and engineers the sheer will and grand diversity of the students taught me too thanks brilliant people are everywhere share and look a million different ways and success has many different starts to do my best i would go to the free tutoring center where i would get help on the subjects i needed to spend extra time on to get an a i remember one tutor in particular who helped me on a daily basis i would walk in every day and sit at her table hello it's me again your best customer after taking macro economics one o one i fell in love with the subject gone was the tardy class stitching loser who is now the eager beaver,1

B00EOWFJHE,the inhabitants of the cities were now counted in tens of thousands and national populations in a few million tens of millions in china with industrialization markets matured on scales unknown even in the earliest commercial societies of the greek and roman mediterranean and the long distance trading routes between arabia india and china manufacturing and the division of labor on an increasingly global scale brought negotiation to it's most refined and complex forms by the twentieth century contact among neighboring populations refined negotiating diplomacy at government levels and in the formulation of state policies towards neighbors and within systems of justice wars were ended in outright victory or peace negotiations and future accommodations between victors and vanquished treaties of peace marriage treaties between rulers and complicated succession and inheritance disputes brought negotiation practice into all aspects of civil government traditional negotiation the essential common structure of negotiation remained as it had always been to parties meeting his principles or through representatives exchanged their different solutions to the common problem both parties faced until a common solution acceptable to both sides was reached all the parties broke off in frustration or discourse odd the essential common factor of all negotiations was the resolution of the conditional offer give me that which i want and you shall have this which you want adam smith seventeen seventy six each side modified it's demands or increased it's offers and perhaps introduced new tradeable until a common acceptable solution was reached or they both failed to agree and saw what they wanted from somebody else this defines traditional negotiation as the process by which we search for terms to obtain what we want from someone who wants something from us in the eighties ed section there are illustrative references to some experiments with alternative reforms or additions to traditional negotiation and comments about their practicality but overall i do not expect the existing negotiation process to change much in the foreseeable future indeed this book is largely about the traditional form that negotiation takes in today's world and what it has evolved into over thousands of years as people explored less bloody and destructive ways which we're common among our predecessors as they set about redistributing the bounties of nature and the fruits of labor plunder and negotiation plunder probably preceded the evolution of negotiation and has always been the singular alternative to it violence is endemic among humans and in the animal kingdom generally as adam smith asserted nobody ever saw a dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with and other dog among animals dominance in various degrees supported by threatened or actual violence generally decides on who gets what it was ever thus but plunder is not a constructive option because although violence can redistribute the bounties of nature and the fruits of labor it cannot create either plunder is the original zero sum option negotiation on the other hand is the socially evolved nonzero sum option for both parties when people value different things differently by exchanging what they value less for what they value more they raise the value to them of all the things that they gain net of what they give up and because they both gain both parties are better off our predecessors discovered this truth after a long period of repetitively testing their experiences and passing on what they learned to their descendants negotiation is no alternative to plunder took a long time to form as the social norm it became in the modern era how important is culture globalization has brought new variants in the form of local cultural attitudes into the mix although much of what passes for local culture is often based on fragile national stereotypes it is asserted that the japanese chinese and arabs prefer to establish personal relations first,1
B00YCP1W3S,one job search misconception that you might have is that the only way to get a job interview is to send your resume to a company in response to a job posting this book is intended to help you understand that there are at least seven ways to get a job interview and they are not equally effective or successful in getting you the interview or priority consideration one the most effective way to get a job interview in the u s is to connect with a hiring manager directly or indirectly with a strong referral and or a recommendation from an employee friend or colleague of the hiring manager the informational interview is a great way to get this kind of referral and recommendation if you do not have a personal connection to the hiring manager listened to the chapter titled the power of the informational inter view a job offer is not guaranteed but the interview is assured and when i use the term hiring manager i am referring to a person in an organization who has the authority to offer you a specific position in all professions in the u s this person can be either a male or female two one of the next best ways to get a job interview is through an employee in good standing referral to the hr department even without a strong recommendation hr professionals assume that an employee will not bring forward a candidate for consideration less call qualified then the employee doing the referring and will often feel an obligation to give the employee's candidate serious consideration companies have also found that job candidates who are recommended by valued employees tend to perform better stay longer and integrate for faster this is why resumes submitted by an employee get special attention as compared to resumes submitted via the internet on job boards company websites and mobile apps three interning or participating in a co-op program is also a very strong way to get an interview and an offer for a full-time position upon graduation particularly if the hiring manager or a close colleague of the hiring manager has had a chance to observe your skills as and strengths first hand listened to the chapters entitled in turning your way to a job and visa laws and your work options three both volunteering and part time work even for a few hours per week on a regular basis are very good ways to get the attention of a hiring manager or an employee who might bring you to the attention of a hiring manager or the hr department for an internship or full time job after graduation listened to the chapter titled volunteer or part-time your way to a job five the fifth way you can get an interview for an internship or full-time job is to impress the recruiter who visits your school during a job fair or an on-campus recruitment visit listen to the chapter titled taking advantage of job fairs and mastering job interviews six the sixth way that you can improve your chances of landing an interview and job requires going around hr to get to the hiring manager with your resume directly why whether or not there is a job posting hr professionals often follow a relatively slow process and may not fully understand the skills and strengths desired by the hiring manager they also may be tied to company policies that discourage the hiring of international students the hiring manager on the other hand is mainly concerned about finding the right candidate as quickly as possible even if it means bending company policy and procedure if you engage him directly and are able to present yourself as an exceptional candidate there is a good chance that he will arrange for you to be interviewed as with the five ways above this approach will bring your resume priority it may be difficult for you to accept the idea that you should avoid the official h r application process but you will increase your odds of success if you do seven the seven,1

B00JU29F3C,in two thousand and four a customer pass along to me an article from the business press which he described as mind numbing he was referring to an announcement by fujio ciao that toyota would post a profit for two thousand and four of eleven billion dollars this number was especially dramatic ic given recent laments by both ford and general motors of losses for the first quarter of two thousand and five each exceeding one billion dollars unfortunately by now the bad news from domestic manufacturers has become a commonplace it hardly seems like news when gm announced in june two thousand and four that it would lay off an additional twenty five thousand employees it was pretty much viewed as more of the same but when toyota suggested that it might raise prices on it's cars to help increase ford and gm sales that seem strange indeed in this topsy turvy move toyota sought to protect itself from a giant killer image fearing backlash from american buyers how we ponder can one manufacturer consistently do well in the same market that is sinking others there is no simple answer to that question but there are are several misconceptions which illuminate the people side of lean not too many years ago there was an unlevel playing field argument much as we hear today except replacing all references to japanese with chinese there was a claim that cheap labor there was stealing american and european jobs less well publicized as those early years of foreign cars was a fact that in the nineteen seventies ford produced six times more cars per factory worker than toyota in any case thirty five years later we live in a time of multi national corporate asians we did like to buy american or european but it's often hard to know if you drive a camry you are buying american or european afford maybe not at least not the u s part of america toyota employs either directly or indirectly sixties seven thousand u s workers to design and build cars vans and trucks and the number of new jobs is growing steadily there so while the money losers downsize and outsource because you can't make money manufacturing in the us the profit leader is adding jobs a second belief still presently held today is in the communalism of japanese culture and a subordination of individual needs to those of the group the negative and misleading implications japanese act in a regimented disciplined fashion like so many ants building an anthill we hear that such a culture could not b impose on the creativity and individualism of american workers a corollary to this argument is that the entitlement american workers feels gives foreign competitors an economic advantage if entitlement means medical coverage and wage sufficient to support a family then surely it poll his is a big problem for many manufacturers benefits derived from a leading manufacturing economy cannot be supported if the leadership is relinquished as for creativity toyota logs fifty improvement ideas per employee every year how is that possible if work is as regiment id as we are led to believe this brings me back to the news article that described toyota's big profits while the headline was about profits further into the body of the article the journalists referred to toyota's big risk as it strives to build a world truck the strategy is this design and build an echo a nominal vehicle that will operate well in many climbs and then open part plants in countries worldwide to generate sufficient income in those areas to support a truck purchase sound suspiciously like henry ford's plan for the model t the risk as a journalist related in that non-jew japanese workers will not be able to adapt to toyota's system so it's no longer just american workers who can't rise to the challenge it's apparently any workers that are not japanese ergo it's the workers that are the problem this was implicit in a journalist evaluation and and most unfortunately ingrained in his psyche of most american management low level jobs are deemed to be outsourcing full and exportable persons in those jobs are expendable a variable expense,1
B0045KSMCE,before the divorce what burton had done was unforgivable he'd hurt her and he cheated her out of funds that were rightfully hers once again she stopped herself not wanting to indulge those bitter memories and regrets she'd done plenty of that in the beginning when when she first learned he'd found someone else and wanted out of their thirty year marriage it was a fling or so she'd managed to convince herself a midlife crisis lots of men had them any day burton would come to his senses and see what he was doing to her and to roy their son only he hadn't and an walked out of divorce court numb with shock and disbelief not until the judge's gavel echoed through the room had she fully believed her husband was capable of such treachery she should have known should have been prepared burton was a top notch notch divorce attorney a persuasive man who knew all the ploys but despite everything she trusted him her friends had been stunned to less by burton's deception than by anne's apparent acceptance of what he'd done to her it wasn't in her to fight to drag her ma marriage and her life through the courts burton had recommended an attorney whom she'd obediently retained never suspecting that the man who'd represented her in court would apply to burton's law firm as soon as the divorce was final of course he'd been hired burton had promised to treat her fairly because she was convinced that he'd soon recognize what a terrible mistake he was making she'd blindly followed his lead without a quibble and on her attorney's advice she'd accepted the settlement offer one that had turned out to be grossly unfair although she hadn't been aware of it at the time and was cheated out of at least two hundred and fifty thousand dollars worth of assets burton's ploy in this particular case had been simple he'd strung her along twice seat come to her in tears begging her forgiveness talking about reconciliation and all the while he'd been shifting their assets to offshore account all the while he'd been lying stealing and cheating she'd loved him and she'd believed him and so had taken her husband at his word never had she dreamed he could betray her like this after thirty years she'd walked away with only a pittance and needless to say no alimony yes and could fight him could take him back to court and expose him for the thief he was but to what end it was best she decided long ago to preserve her dignity eighty she'd always felt that life had a symmetry to it a way of righting wrongs and that somehow eventually god would restore to her the things she'd lost it was this belief that had gotten her past the bitterness and indignation admittedly she couldn't help lapse sing sometimes but an tried not to feel bitter at this point she couldn't see how anger even righteous anger could possibly benefit her she suggested taking the little she'd managed to salvage from her marriage she'd purchased a small cottage on st gabriel a tiny cell san juan island in puget sound in college all those years ago when she'd met burton she'd been an art student she had a flair for art and enjoyed it given the demands of being married to a prominent divorce lawyer she'd put aside her own pursuits to assist burton her husband's ambitions had become her own and anne was the perfect wife and hostess it had been a disappointment to her to have only one child a son they named after anne's father young roy was the light of her life her ray of sunshine through the years when she was and house dissing social events on her husband's behalf and spent her time with roy raising him with limitless love and motherly devotion if she felt any bitterness about the way burton had treated her it was because of what he'd done deroy unfortunately roy roy was the one who'd introduced burton to amy he'd never forgiven himself for that despite anne's reassurances still roy assumed responsibility for what had happened he couldn't seem to forgive himself for his role in the divorce,0

B07BWQW6TT,i hate being busy and the laziest ambitious person i know tim kreider i've been running small businesses since the year two thousand some successful some not playable and a shed load of really useful stuff along the way and there are some common traits amongst the successful businesses that have created traits that just about anyone can put into practice to take their business to the next level regardless of what level you're currently at i've hired staff fired staff taking people to court made a billion quid lost a million quid so businesses bought businesses laid awake at night

quit the data back in two thousand and one to chase a dream of becoming an internet millionaire despite not even owning a computer let alone having access to the internet on it or knowing anything about web design internet marketing or on how to actually run a business and yet i did become an internet millionaire granted i didn't manage to keep many those millions but i did earn them nowadays i run several companies in sports betting property sectors and i meant to ambitious lifestyle business owners oh and i still do some stuff on the internet i've stopped chasing the dream of making millions now though and started living like a millionaire instead more on this in the next chapter i wrote this book to share some of the simple practical ways to grow a small business that i've picked up over the last couple of decades if you're looking for the latest silver bullet techniques that invoke creating a funnel the size of a cross channel ferry you're going to be disappointed if

really move your business forward in twenty to twenty five hours a week and spend the rest of the time with the family friends on the golf course sailing at the gym looking at cap videos on the internet or whatever else floats your boat i meant to ambitious lifestyle business owners and this book is for them don't instantly turn your nose up because i used the term lifestyle business i've never really understood the disregard that so many people have for lifestyle businesses i'm forever hearing people say things like oh they'll only ever be a lifestyle business or oh they're not a real business they're just a life do business i'm not talking about someone who's pursuing a hobby and dressing it up as a business i'm talking about owners of small businesses who have ambition drive a

B0036KMJNC,what opportunities does it identify for us what changes in goals strategies policies structure might it point to we then discuss our respective answers at one of our management meetings and six months later we discuss the same answers again to see what actions we have an actually taken and how they have worked out but also what actions we should have taken and might still undertake of course a good many of your chapters do not directly apply to us they lead to understanding rather than to action but a good many again and again stimulate us to do something or to stop doing something and the most valuable ones are the chapters that make me say of course i have known this all along why haven't i acted on it the chapters in this book cover a wide range of topics and they were written over a five year period the individual chapters were not planned to fill a spot on an outline sketched out five years ago but each was most definitely designed from the beginning to address one of the dimensions of the executives world the economy and economics people management organization both outside and inside the executives particular enterprise in addition each chapter was planned from the beginning to achieve two purposes one to explain to executives immersed in the demands of their own tasks and their own enterprise to understand the rapidly changing world in which they work and produce results the other was to stimulate them to action and to provide tools for effective action the executives world has been turbulent for as long as i can remember i started work two years before the nineteen twenty nine crash it surely has always been turbulent but never as much as in these past few years or in the years immediately ahead only a few short years ago for instance we worried about inflation and about the ascendancy of all kinds of new financial superpowers global banks transnational brokerage houses junk bond kings takeover tycoons and the like inflation is of course still a danger and will remain one as long as governments pile up huge deficit it's but executives in the nineties are more likely to be worried by financial stringencies and credit crunches that is by the typical deflation symptoms the monetary giants of yesterday are everywhere in full retreat and mired in scandal the international economy of nineteen nine eighty two while so bears almost no resemblance to that of nineteen eighty or nineteen eighty one when japan still ran a trade deficit the european economic community was still pie in the sky and lending billions to brazilian generals still seemed to be the truly conservative thing to do so every chapter in this book tries to create understanding of what changes are ahead and what they mean for the economy people markets management the organization every one of the chapters tries to create the understanding the executive needs to manage for tomorrow rather than for yesterday but every chapter was also designed from the beginning to stimulate action to identify new opportunities to point out areas where changes in process and product policies markets and structure might be needed where and what to do and where and what to stop doing the five years during which the chapters of this book were being written were years of unprecedented political upheaval the earliest chapter in this book was written in august nineteen eighty six in the same week i wrote the first draft of what was published in early winter of nineteen eighty nine as chapter four in my book the new re realities under the title when the russian empire is gone an essay in which i predicted the inevitable failure of mr gorbachev's economic policies the equally inevitable collapse of communism and the disintegration of the soviet union but the chapter i wrote that week for this book it is chapter twenty two bears the title how to manage the boss the most recently written chapter in this book chapter twenty four was done almost exactly five years later in august nineteen ninety one in the week after the communist hardliners putsch against mr gorbachev had failed its title however is the new jack japanese business strategies this book in other words focuses on executives in their organizations and in their work,1
B002UZX5S2,let me be candid with you before you go on this book covers one hundred guerrilla marketing weapons is that all there are of course not there may be two hundred weapons even one thousand in time i have purposely limited my list to one hundred but this is no reason for you to limit yours after you've evaluated the weapons in this book i hope you'll invent your own new weapons stay alert to the development of other new weapons and always be ready to add to your arsenal reread the title of this chapter to see why what you hold in your hands is both the key to the arsenal and an invaluable source book unlike conventional weaponry many of the guerrilla marketing weapons are absolutely free if you're a student of guerilla marketing and you'd better be to survive in the fiercely competitive environment of the nineteen nineties and beyond you know full well that gorilla marketing requires that you invest time energy and imagination in your marketing not simply huge amounts of dollars this book gives you ample opportunity to make those investments to be sure your efforts pay off handsomely i sincerely recommend that you read guerilla marketing and guerilla marketing attack after all to be a gorilla with your weaponry you should first be a gorilla with your head heart soul and spirit feel good deep inside that the vast majority of your competitors are not aware of one hundred marketing weapons perhaps they know only fifteen weapons or possibly as few as five i'll bet most of your competitors are actually using only one two or three weapons child's play yeah you will be aware of all one hundred weapons you will utilize forty fifty or possibly even more my average client uses forty seven once i was giving a lecture on guerilla marketing to an audience of about two hundred business owners i spent an hour rattling off my full list of one hundred weapons then i asked for audience participation how many of you i asked are using between zero and ten weapons answer by raising your hands a handful of hands shot up how many are using between ten and twenty more hands were raised between twenty and thirty fewer hands between thirty and forty hardly any hands between forty and fifty one or two hands finally i asked anyone using more than fifty weapons a man in the middle of the room raised his hand sheepishly you're using more than fifty guerrilla marketing weapons i inquired i'm using eighty four responded the man with his hand raised to the ceiling that's wonderful i said it's not so wonderful he said i'm ignoring sixteen weapons turns out that the man with the eighty four weapons was president of a leading chain of weight loss clinics with over three hundred offices throughout america it also turns out that he later hired me to help him activate some of the other sixteen weapons he wasn't using i guess some people are natural born gorillas this guy certainly was oz and his bank account proved it if you don't have any innate gorilla tendencies though i suspect you may have them simply because you're reading this book rest assured that guerrilla marketing tactics can be learned they need not be part of your dna look at the list of weapons in the contents and consider how many you are using right now then realize that you are offered information about a host of new weapons the addition of even one or two new weapons to your own arsenal can make a dramatic difference to your financial statement think of the effect of an additional eleven or twelve or forty two when you've completed this book if you don't add a whole slew of new weapons to your arsenal one of us is nuts i was paid well to write this book and i had a whale of a time doing it so you're the guilty party if you don't use this information to add potency to your marketing attack and plenitude to your prophets understand that these weapons are strictly oriented to your prophets some misguided souls obviously not gorilla does use these weapons to bolster their sales their volume their turnover their egos don't fall into those traps guerrilla marketing weapons should be employed to increase your profits the other goals are foolish anyone can boost sales with sufficient marketing but they can lose money in the process www carry on guerilla like any one can enlarge volume and turnover with these weapons but that is not the intent of these pages many people pamper their egos with these weapons they are smitten with the idea of seeing their businesses in the newspaper their names on tv their offer is in the mail take my word these are not gorillas these are game players and some may be simpletons gorillas see to it that they're in investments of time energy imagination and money pay off in pure delicious profits if ego gratification is a byproduct well that's just fine but that's the side dish not the main course if you are like most business people on planet earth you probably think that marketing weapons cost money guess what you're only half right of the one hundred guerrilla marketing weapons fifty do cost money to be sure in some cases it is merely a pittance such as the cost to produce reprints of publicity stories or run off a batch of circulars but fully half of these weapons are completely free in this book they are boxed for easy reference they do require the investment of time energy and imagination but they ask for zero investment of money i wonder how many of these free weapons you are using at this moment i wonder how many you'll use when you complete this book when i told you that my average client uses forty seven of these weapons i neglected to mention that in many cases the client isn't paying a cent for thirty seven of them yet it's true in many cases the free weapon will be more effective than the paid weapon radio talk show interviews almost always out radio commerce fuels naturally that's a function of a sixty minute commercial over a sixty second commercial still both our radio and one weapon is free one hundred guerrilla marketing weapons neatly categorized how should i present these weapons to you in alphabetical order by rank of importance in order of popularity no none of those categories does these weapons justice the categories must jiggle your brain a bit so you can see how many weapons fit together there are proper times and places for all guerrilla marketing weapons let's start with the first of eight categories to prove that point one weapons for the outset fourteen weapons fall into this category even if you're outside his past and gone it's a smart idea to review these weapons and determine how well you're using them two weapons not recognized as part of marketing if you don't have these sixteen weapons in your current arsenal you will have some of them soon when you do it's necessary that you understand these are part of marketing three weapons that begin with attitudes many of these dozen weapons are the secret to the success of a surprisingly high number of companies just because many are free doesn't mean they're easy to use with skill for weapons overlooked by non gorillas several of these eighteen weapons can justifiably lay claim to the greatest effectiveness of any weapon it's tough to argue with gorillas who have used them to earn fortunes five weapons that make you easy to buy from although a few of these nine weapons might fit into other categories the category chosen makes the most sense if you're not easy to buy from in the nineteen nineties you're a goner six weapons that are frequently misused these eight weapons fit several categories but none as important as this one gorillas don't just use weapons they employ them with expertise and effectiveness seven weapons that produce instant results wait don't go scurrying over to this category chapter eight if you must to activate it's sixteen weapons until you've considered the other guerrilla marketing weapons eight weapons that have extra fire power it's well and good to you as marketing weapons that cost not one penny but it's even more fulfilling to use seven weapons that can blast your competitors to smithereens if you're a ride thinking gorilla your recognize the need to look into every one of these categories even if you're in an established firm you'll want to check that you didn't miss anything at the outset you'll want to see which weapons aren't known to be part of marketing but definitely are you'll probably want to run an attitude jack on yourself and your people you won't want to overlook any potential profit producer of course you'll want to make it easy to buy what you sell,1

B07G5HR1D3,ever since the founding of the united states policymakers have wrestled with numerous national security challenges among the most persistent has been the organization and manning of the army should the country field a regular army composed of full-time well trained professional soldiers hers or should it rely on a malicious system of civilians called to arms only when the country faces a military threat which organization is better suited for defending the country the militia national guard or the united states army should the institutional culture of the army to take precedence over that of the militia national guard who performs better in combat the professional regular army soldier who is trained in the craft of war or the civilian soldier of the militia who answers the call to arms when foreign armies threatened the nation for many decades the arguments surrounding these questions played out in a rivalry between the united states army and the militia which was later known as the national guard world war two merged the two into a single body and resolved the issue in favor of the u s army but without eliminating the national ga card's existence or distinctiveness this professional vs malicious soldier debate began prior to the establishment of the united states american colonists came to despise the soldiers of their own british army during the years preceding the american war for independence finding them at best an annoyance and at worst a threat to liberty when british regular shot to death their fellow subjects during the boston massacre and at lexington and concord those actions verified in the minds of many the warnings of radical pamphleteers that a standing army of professional soul rogers was an instrument of governmental oppression once the war began many asked did not the militia defend the cause of freedom against regulars at the battle of bunker hill and before the war was over americans commonly believed that the national virtue of the people in arms not the regular soldiers of the continental army had defeated the british army many citizens had concluded that a people's army of civilian soldiers the militia was the most appropriate military institution for a democracy concurrently a reliance on the militia implied that there would b no standing army available to oppress innocent citizens and besides so went the story from the revolution militia soldiers were militarily superior to the automatons of a professional army those who had seen the combat performance of both however saw great merit in the estee establishment of a regular professional army in order to exploit that technical expertise inherit in a professional corps by the time the states ratified the constitution the people of the united states were perpetuating a form of the malicious system from their colonial days and at the same time were really directly funding and they sent standing army both kinds of armies performed inconsistently during the united states' next major conflict the war of eighteen twelve after some false starts forces of the u s army finally defeated british regulars in close combat on july fifth eighteen fourteen months of rigorous training made possible the american's achievement at the battle of chippewa but militia forces never trained with the commitment of the u s army it was challenging to even get them to fight but during the war's final battle that seemed to make no difference after all andrew jackson's motley crew defeated a force of veteran british regulars in the battle of new orleans the argument for the superiority of the militia gained more credence many national leaders nevertheless concluded that the war of eighteen twelve confirmed the country's need for a professional army of some sort if for no other reason then then to form the basis for a larger army one that would train man taken from civilian life during a time of national crisis and turn them into soldiers,0

B00K26ES82,building a successful practice is an evolution not a revolution and identifying what strategies and techniques are missing from your business is the first step the following chapters will each explore one of the success principles with anecdotes from the top advisors that illustrate how they have applied these lessons and how you you can implement them too briefly here are the lessons you'll discover the mindset our top advisers all have a common mindset toward the business and many have common personality traits they operate with a high level of confidence they provide an aura of being at the top of their game they are very competitive they know their exact business numbers and hr rankings among their peers they have been goal oriented throughout their career and remained that way even though they are at the top of their game they continue to have aspirations to do more and become better when asked what their goals were they could articulate them immediately and succinctly these obj directives were a part of a greater revision that they had for their business from the beginning of their careers they've had a strong work ethic most of these top advisers are still putting in fifty hours a week they keep their energy levels high as well as their passion for business these top advisers are leaders and provide leadership to the their team and clients throughout their careers they have shown personal courage by being willing to risk failure to achieve success they are excellent one on one communicators with a sincere interest in helping people and putting the needs of their clients ahead of themselves because they're concerned for their clients is their first pr priority and their ethics are beyond reproach their clients and prospects instinctively trust them trustworthiness contributes greatly to their success leverage of size our top advisers understand that leverage in financial services is based on the size of the relationships the amount of assets each client has invested with each advisor this is far more important than the total number of relationships under management these men and women didn't start out understanding this concept but they all evolved to adopt it in the beginning most of these advisors focused on the number of new accounts they opened without regard to size but as their careers progressed they kept raising the minimums and reducing the total number of client relationships they all learned that it doesn't take any more time to invest one million dollars in assets than one hundred thousand dollars but the payoff is ten times greater by working with fewer highly affluent clients these advisors provide the time required to service them while still generating a large volume of business professional development as the top advisers told their stories it became clear that they recognized early on the need to set themselves apart from the competition they devoted time and resources to be the best whether it was professional designations ongoing education or searching for better and more efficient busy this practices these advisers continued to be students of the game they never quit learning they were students of the markets always working to provide the best investment advice possible to their clients they had an insatiable appetite for the business looking at it as more than just a job,1

B01G5LGRCM,preface who are you going to believe me or your lying eyes richard pryor although you would not know it from reading it in your daily newspaper watching it on the evening news or hearing it from the federal government during the past decade especially since nineteen ninety two enormous advance nces have been made in unraveling one of the greatest crimes of our time the assassination of president john f kennedy the murder was a state offense for which no one has ever been convicted after more than thirty five years many americans tend to think what happened will never be known and there is nothing new to learn and that opinion may be widely held but it is also completely wrong we know vastly more now than we ever have before and we are learning more every day what happened to this nation on twenty two november nineteen sixty three occurred as a result of a meticulously executed can spirits he whose character was concealed by a massive cover up indeed unraveling the cover up has provided an access route to understanding the conspiracy which deprive the american people of their democratically elected leader a research group whose members came together and shared outrage over the blatant abuse of a leading medical journal in a crude but effective effort to perpetuate the cover up with the complicity of our nation's press has discovered the jfk autopsy x-rays have been fabricated autopsy photographs have been distorted or destroyed the brain seen in official diet grams and photographs belonged to someone other than jfk the autopsy report was a sham and a great deal of the photographic record including the zapruder film of the assassination has been edited by means of sophisticated techniques we have made strenuous efforts to bring these f findings to the attention of the public including repeated communications with the new york times a b c news and the u s department of justice but to no avail as we have documented in assassination science nineteen ninety eight a collection of studies devoted to placing research on the death of jfk upon an object active and scientific foundation the authors whose work appears there include a world authority on the human brain who is also an expert on wound ballistics who has confirmed the substitution of someone else's brain for that if jfk a phd in physics who was also board certified in radiation oncology who has verified the fabrication of jfk autopsy x-rays and several experts on various aspects of the photographic record who have found detailed evidence of film and photo alteration as a professional philosopher and former marine corps officer i have served as a catalytic agent by nurturing promoting and directing many of these efforts such as by moderating a press conference in new york city on eighteen november nineteen ninety three during which important medical findings were presented by organizing a symposium on the alteration of the zapruder film for a national convention then on twenty one through twenty two november nineteen ninety six and by conducting the first professional conference on the death of jfk on a major campus at the university of minnesota twin cities fourteen through sixteen may nineteen ninety eight it has been my great pleasure to work with the most highly qualified in individuals to ever study the assassination of jfk and i welcome the opportunity to advance their publication the present volume extends and deepens our past findings by taking advantage of new evidence provided by the release of more than sixty thousand documents and records by the assassination records review you board a r r be an entity of five persons created by congress in the wake of the interest in this case rekindled by oliver stone's film jfk just as the house select committee on assassinations hsc a reinvestigation of nineteen seventy seven through seventy eight had been incited by a tell division broadcast of the zapruder film the evidence to which we have now had access not only substantiates our previous findings but also enables us to understand and rather precise detail how the cover up was conducted,0
B00CYKEDTI,introduction seeing with peripheral vision this book is for people who are striving to live with integrity and purpose at work but are increasingly troubled by the compromises double binds and contradictions of organizational life and for those who want to avoid such messes in the first place is for professionals at all levels at all stages in their careers who bring energy and commitment to their work but i have a growing uneasiness with ways they are not being fully true to themselves whether breaking promises stretching the truth or something more severe and it's for those who are not sure in this book we explore the problem of unhealthy pressure to compromise at work the feeling that you may have to drink the kool-aid play the game in negative ways or or sell your soul to survive or reach your goals compromising your personal values commitments or professional standards in the process drawing on in-depth interviews with more than fifty business people in a variety of industries as well as on my own experiences in the trenches with a global corporation nineteen years of consulting experience diagnosing breakdowns and dysfunctions in large complex organizations and a number of studies in social psychology i hope to show how over or time unhealthy compromise actually becomes a self depleting trap hurting you your organization and your organization's ability to fulfill it's commitments and obligations to the larger world my goal is to invite you instead to redefine the game to engage at a higher level deliberately we conceiving what your work is about knowing that it's not just a game but real life compromise is the tricky subject compromising on anything never feels completely rider satisfying and it's always challenging to look at a problem when you're not sure there is any other option i hope that ideas presented here will solidify more options in your mind so that you'll feel more confident rift acting on which compromises involved making the best of a bad situation and which go too far in a way this book is about seeing with your peripheral vision that is recognizing what you partly know but that has not yet fully come into focus the periphery of awareness is often where you learn the most as old habits make what is right in front of you too familiar for insight by widening your gaze to include what is just outside your normal f focus you can sometimes see what you've been missing and increase the possibility of actually learning from your experience my own first glance into peripheral vision happened back in nineteen ninety three two years at a business school i was working for a group of brilliant and passionate re engineering consultants as the numbers person responsible for calculating the client's financial payoff for project proposals to streamline processes provide better technology tools or trained front line client staff when i first started i was absolutely convinced of the massive potential for improvement and reflected those assumptions in my analyses it was only after seeing the re realities of large scale organizational change on several projects that i began to realize how unrealistic my projections were thus after my third major engagement i felt a profound uneasiness as i sat with one of our senior leaders making a pitch to a prospective client we think you can get a thirty five percent reduction in cycle time and a twenty per cent reduction in unit costs by the end of the year i knew as soon as the words came out of my mouth that they were false what had at one point been a passionate conviction was now a lie i call this a case of peripheral vision because the facts of the situation had not changed but inside i saw things differently something tip the moment i actually spoke the words and i suddenly knew what i really thought this experience and others like it forced me to confront the the ways i sometimes tune out data that contradict my preferred beliefs at first facing these discrepancies caused me much private angst unhealthy compromise so often comes with the option to avoid realizing that fact to tune it out rationalize it away or change our standards we don't have to say see though enron's motto was ask why one x trader said if i had questions i didn't ask them because i didn't want to know the answer sometimes it seems easier to shut out the data that raised too many unsolvable complications but there are some very good reasons for tuning in to peripheral awareness first seeing more of reality makes us saner things make more sense we don't have to spend all that psychic energy tap dancing round the minefields of awareness i'm trying not to think what we're about to think this means we can actually make a change for example it was not long after facing my own compromise and my work situation that i made the commitment to pursue a different type of consulting that more openly acknowledges the challenges of large scale change the brand of consulting our practice today almost two decades later,1

B0787NXRP3,jim let's get back into it how can leaders prepare their organizations for disruption and and innovation i i i'm asked at a fair bit and and i think i think it boils down to two things from my perspective man and i'm sure there's others so i don't have a monopoly on this but but they go on two sides of the coin to continue what i was saying before the break is is i ask leaders in the client people i work with is to pay attention to the chain if you don't don't don't download that knowledge about what's coming to others and be up just get yourself up to speed on the on the the great thinking and research and the work that's being done from outside your industry because it's actually the combination of technologies from outside your industry that will potentially be the most disruptive and so i encourage you to you know not not not become a technical geek but but certainly during the reading income at some of the great publications that they mentioned peter demand is in the singularity you she spent an hour a week reading that that that stuff that would be great to us on the one side keep up to date and spend the time and energy learning outside your your equal the second is more personal his innovation from my my my work research here in the city of calgary comes from a culture of trust and and what i mean by that is that innovation requires us to step outside of our comfort zone to reach out to other parts of of of of our world and that requires us to suspend traditional forms of capitalism which means i win you lose and and and i think we need to re rethink that and until ash meters to to really examine the level of trust and the culture of trust within their organization to absorb new ideas and tips to understand that failure and the trust in failure at it if something to be to be really understood and so you know in summary understand what's coming and spend the energy and time and conversely look inside your organization as human beings around the culture trumps and the culture itself yeah i do to go back and read the underlined with jim sharing with this a command and control has limitations especially with rapid change as collaborative leaders innovate they play outside their ecosystem they'll stop playing with the same toys in the same sand box you know not going to the petroleum club and sitting at the same table get to olds alberta lots of great exciting things get get this and luis obispo great exciting stuff happening there it'll go go to rebel france this is a global opportunity do you want to be on the bus you want to drive the bus or do you want to get run over by the bus the i guess the the other part of this is it brings up to my mind when i used to be a chief operating officer or director or vp business development in various companies in my forty one years we used to say well maybe we can protect five percent of our budget this year care to look at the future and innovation and change that doesn't work anymore you know you're you're putting yourself in a in a limited opportunity and as allah shared with the institute of corporate directors this work the gym is consulting leading and writing a boat and talking about is the way it will be and this needs to be your commitment from the board right to the person at the reception desk now one of the really exciting things to i heard about about six weeks ago and really looking forward to hearing more about is the rainforest initiative gym can you what can you tell our listeners about that and with respect to disruptive technology startups innovation and an opportunity david if there is a really great story and it's a long one and i'll go get to i'll get that to the shorter version if there's a book called the rainforest the making of silicon valley conducted and or or a built and and altered by a gentleman called victor wang long story short as addict or looked at ecosystems all over the world and basically tried to figure out from a macro and micro economic viewpoint why do some succeed and why do some fail,1
B0765C2C7P,part three unleashing creativity in a sense providing absolute clarity and empowering an obsession to go ninety know at ntc or achieve twenty percent earnings growth every year enabled the most cogent of the three magical meta themes unleashing creativity achieving extreme levels of performance required relentless innovation in multiple parts of the organization all at the same time ingenuity and creativity flourished they were the source of the dramatic improvements in everyday functions within these organizations that allowed them to realise their purpose the thirst for better ways of doing things was deeply interwoven into the organizational mindset like the explosion of innovation that arose during world war two when entire nations were obsessed with winning the war creative minds in every part of these organizations focused extreme levels of energy on developing new technologies processes and methods that would enable achieved the purpose these creative environments were not like artistic open thought communities or undirected research labs the innovation was supremely purposeful neither striker nor task force for six eight was looking for fashionable ideas that would lead to immediate but only short term gains striker's focus was on products serve offices and enabling processes on which a lasting business could be built over many years and for six eight developed the playbook and it's battle plans to win every maneuver battle every time new ideas had to contribute to that overall goal consultants who studied striker in the late nineteen nineties termed it innovate ocean that indoors unleashing creativity brought about thousands of little innovations that were the crucial catalyst in delivering exceptional results in both organizations challenging the status quo inventing new methods envisioning better ways to do things and devising new and improved processes or procedures were incurred averaged at all levels those ideas that resulted in significant advances were highly lauded and praised especially from the top once again the influence of the top leaders was remarkably similar fred dibella was outfront voraciously collecting ideas asking for input and driving the refinement of the playbook and other priests seizures across the task force john brown constantly pushed and prodded for new ideas and improvements throughout the company he was a primary catalyst for spreading the stories of success wide he was also actively involved with the hiring for r and d leadership in every division there were common expectations and enabling pat patterns of behavior that you could count on inside either organization three consistent elements described as similar influence and unleashing creative energies first through their personal involvement these leaders created environments of direct honest and open communication that elevated ideas on the basis of their merits challenging the status quo was permitted and even encouraged and the top leaders set the example ideas were celebrated and shared and their inventors were recognized and rewarded the evaluation criteria were also simple and objective summed up in a statement heard from multiple leaders in both organizations if it were works do it second the champions of ideas could find resources for experimentation to validate or invalidate ideas this is not to say that there was some magical pool of assets available to go after every idea there was not time money and other needed resources were precious commodities and for an idea to obtain those resources it had to have champions the effort to secure crucial assets or their scarcity typically strengthen the resolve to make the ideas work it also weeded out those with lukewarm commitments there was high accountability for the champions but also a high tolerance for failure this seemingly key contradictory ethos was clearer than it sounds both leaders exhibited a considerable understanding for mistakes of the mind but little for mistakes of the heart third they established a pervasive organizational mindset in which the organizations members at all levels worked to constantly improve many of the most important innovations arose out of the relentless energy poured into making systems processes or products just a little better every day incremental gg gains every day every week and every month in primary support systems compounded over time and led to dramatic system improvements in many cases these highly evolved systems gave the organizations fundamental advantages all of these were key facilitators of the extraordinary results,1

B00NNW1CLS,then increasing their market share are trying to shave more off their operating costs how do you as a salesperson respond to this assault on your company's profits and on your personal income the answer is power negotiating when you learn to become a power negotiator you will know how to get anything you want from the buyer and still have them thinking that they won and i don't mean by tricking them into doing something they wouldn't do if they were smart are better informed i mean always leaving the buyer with the permanent perception that they won the impossible you say no not to a power negotiator as a sales person you've probably heard that the objective and the negotiation is to create a win-win solution a creative way that both you and the buy a walk away from the negotiating table feeling that you won you may have had this demonstrated to you with the illustration of two people both of whom wanted orange but are frustrated because they only have one orange between them so they talk about it for awhile and decide that the best they can do is split the orange down the middle and each settled for half of what they really need to be sure that it's fair they decide that one will care and the other will choose however as they talk about their underlying needs in the negotiation they find that one once the orange to make juice and the other needs it for the ryan because he wants to bake a cake they have magically found a way that both of them can win and neither has to lose oh sure that could happen in the real world but it is didn't have enough to make it worthwhile let's face it when you're sitting down in front of a buyer if you're lucky enough and skillful enough to get to sit down with the buyer he wants the same thing that you want there's not going to be a magical win-win solution he wants the lowest price and you want the highest price he wants to take money off of your bottom line and put it right onto him his power negotiating takes a different position power negotiating teaches you how to win at the negotiating table but leaving the buyer thinking that he or she won in fact i'd almost give you that as a definition of a power negotiated to says people might go out to meet with two buyers who are in exactly the same circumstance both of this salespeople my clothes to sell at exactly the same price and terms but the power negotiate it comes away with the buyer feeling that he won the poor negotiate it comes away with the buyer feeling that he lost i'm going to teach you how to do this and do it in such a way that the buyer permanently feels that he won he doesn't wake up the next morning thinking now i know what that says person did to me wait until i see him again no he'll be thinking what a great time he had negotiating with you and how he can't wait to see you again if you'll learn and apply the secrets of power negotiating then i'll teach you in this program you'll never again feel that you lost to a buyer you'll always come away from the negotiating table knowing that you won and knowing that you have improved your relationship with the buyer you play power negotiating by a set of rules just like the game of chance the big difference between negotiating and chess is that when negotiating the other side doesn't have to know the rules the other side will respond predictably to the moves that you make now because of metaphysical magic but from tens of thousands of responses over the years we know how the other side will react not every time of course but enough of the time to make negotiating more of a science than it is an art let me illustrate that with this little exercise think of a number between one and ten multiply that number by nine add the two digits together takeaway five translate that into a letter of the alphabet a b c d f etc now think of a country that starts with that letter take the second letter of that country and think of an animal that starts with that letter now tell me something how do i know that you're thinking of an elephant in denmark how do i know that if you live in the northwest from oregon to the dakotas you thinking of an elk in denmark and how do i know that if you're driving in heavy traffic you've got lost on a map and are nowhere close is not because i'm a genius it's because i've done this with thousands of people and i know how predictable the responses are it's the same way you wouldn't negotiating the other side will respond predictably to the moves that you make not every time of course but enough of the time to make negotiating more of a science and it is an art if you play chess you know that players call the strategic moves of the game gambits a word that also suggests an element of risk there are beginning is to get the game started in your direction there are middle game is to keep the game moving in your direction and there are ending gamers to use when you get ready to checkmate the other person or incentives palin's close the sale on the first seven sides in this album i'll teach you the gambits apparent negotiating first you'll learn,1

B00O33VSV0,in credo i believe when you go to take out a loan from a financial institution and you fill out all the paperwork they don't hand you a check right away they do something between the time you get a check in the time you've filled out the paperwork and it's called a credit check a credit check as a belief check what the financial institution simply wants to know is when you've had a loan before when you've had credit before have you paid back with interest it's on time constituents do the same thing with leaders and they ought to do that they ought to find out before they invest their time talent money career livelihood before they invest all of that in a leader they need to ask you need to ask i need to ask people a about the credit worthiness of those that we might follow and when we think about it in a positive sense don't you and i want more credit in our bank account you get a credit card it has a credit limit on it and you can only spend up to that limit and then your credit has to be increased well to increase your credit so you can draw on that credit when you need it you're going to have to do things to make investments to increase your net worth so that people will believe enough in you that they'll loan you more money time talent energy and commitment so building credibility really is about investing in yourself to increase your credit worthiness so other people will increase your line of credit when the time comes to make bigger changes you'll have a longer line of credit to drawn there may come a time also when somebody asks you well why do we need to make this change why do we have to do this things seemed to be fine just the way they are then you'll have to turn to him and say just trust me and that's the time when you really want a lot of credit in your account that's what credibility is the i suppose my research on leadership actually began when i was a kid i was an eagle scout i achieved the rank of eagle at the youngest age have any eagle scout in the united states at the time and because of that in my home town being washington d c i was invited to be in john f kennedy's honor guard and i was so taken by kennedy and other leaders at the time that was the time in the united states when there was so much going on with the race into space and civil rights movement the war on poverty that i decided that i would try to be of service myself and i got very interested in what compelled people like me and my contemporaries to want to follow leaders to bring about some kind of change then if we fast forward to the future i ran into a colleague barry posner at santa clara university where i was for several years and barry and i found that we had a common interest in their common interest was in values and what were the values that inspired people to work where they worked or to do what they did id barry and i found we had a common interest in that area so i teamed up with barry to look at that and that exploration of values led us to an exploration of leadership we collaborated on our first book the leadership challenge and found that in the leadership challenge there was one bit of research that intrigued us and intrigued our audience and it was not only about what leaders did to get extraordinary things done in organizations but it was about what people wanted from their leaders what constituents wanted what you and i want from our leaders so we began a research project and asked the question very simply what do you look for in admire in a leader someone whose direction you would willingly follow and a key word in that sentence is willingly what would you want from someone if you were going to sign up for that person's expedition we developed an interview schedule and interviewed people and then eventually a survey and found that over time now over a dozen years there were consistent responses,1
B0043503AA,and the elephant to hollywood written and written by michael kate the the prologue well it's a long way from london's elephant and castle to hollywood and the shortest distance between two points is not always a straight line as my stories can approve but then i'd never been known for doing things the easy way i wouldn't have minded easy but things just never worked out like that in fact although i couldn't have known it at the time they worked out a whole lot better eighteen years ago i thought of my career as an actor was over so i wrote my autobiography what's it all about round of my professional life and that as far as i was concerned was that fortunately and not for the first time i was wrong very wrong the best was yet to come them which when you look back at my life the crazy sixty's the stardom the glitz and glamour of hollywood it's really saying something the last eighteen years have been different different style different places and different ideas of happiness but different has not only been good it has been better than i could ever have imagined so this is a story of a man who thought it was all over and found out it wasn't his history of the last eighteen years but it's also the story of where i came from and where i'm going i know many people have read my first book but you don't get to my age without looking back and god knows i've been to plenty of memorial services so i'm not going to apologize for telling some of the old tales but there are plenty of new stories too because i've had the good fortune to work with a whole new generation of movie stars and that puts me in a uniquely privileged position there aren't many actors whose career has spanned nearly fifty years of moviemaking from zulu to the dark knight and there aren't many actors who have had happy birthday sam haskell iii and marilyn like into their ear both by carly simon and scarlett johansson twenty years apart everyone gets lucky now and then and i've had some lucky breaks i've been lucky too with friends and agents and supporters who have all looked out for me but if there's one person i feel i over the way the last eighteen years have gone it's jack nicholson in fact if it wasn't for him i wouldn't be reading this book to you now i have jack to thank for the resurrection of my movie career i know he's not everyone's idea of a fairy godmother but he did it for me i'll explain how later but it could have all been very different this is not a serious tome by pompous old actor above all i'm an entertainer so please feel free to laugh i wanted to share the joy and fun and the good fortune i've had with friends to tell you about things i've done in the places i've been and about how when i got there it was never the way i thought it would be in many ways this is an innocent venture into the unknown so i'm pleased you want to come along for the ride to you and me bonvoy ash,0
B01FEAXR32,in the use after the first world war british politics was shaped by the emergence of the labour party as an independent force backed by the trade unions and explicitly committed to socialism in nineteen eighteen fear of labour's potential kept the conservatives in the key coalition formed to win the war under the liberal prime minister david lloyd george in nineteen twenty two distaste for his personality and disgust at his policies led to a backbench revolt that broke the coalition and reconstituted the prewar battle between the lib morals and conservatives into a three corner fight with labour this in itself turned out to be a moderating contest with the liberals fractured by the war visibly declining but not yet finished both labour and conservative politicians saw a realistic route to power in attracting former liberal voters rather than pandering to their own extremists and strove to capture the middle ground despite it's opponents fears the labor movement was never a transmission vector for international bolshevism revolutionary marxism had little sway either among the middle-class fabian socialists who made up the part his intellectual wing or among the great trade union leaders who combined a determination to defend their members' interests with a deep patriotism belief in tradition and respect for the constitution since this mirrored liberal and conservative attachment to parliamentary demar chrissy the dominant trend on all sides was to work within the existing system rather than to break it the labour leader ramsay macdonald matched have faith in a socialist paradise with a trust that gradual progress was the best way to get there labour must demonstrate it's fitness for power by working within the rules the conservative leader stanley baldwin who had played a leading role in destroying the lloyd george coalition spent the rest of the nineteen twenties house training his party against the inclinations of it's more reactionary members baldwins conservatism was run by and for middle class businessman but staged an appeal to all britons as the guarantor of social peace like many of his colleagues baldwin was deeply worried about whether a newly democratic britain could cope with the challenges of the postwar era as he put it privately in june nineteen twenty nine democracy has arrived at a gallop and i feel all the time that it is a race for life can we educate them before the crash comes unlike more pessimistic conservatives however baldwin retained a belief in the fundamental moderation and good sense of the british people provided they were given the appropriate lead as a counter to the dangers of the new democracy baldwin summoned up an invented tradition of it delek national tranquillity together he and mcdonald did more than any other two individuals to ensure that the uk successfully navigated the transition to mass democracy the conservatives dominated nineteen twenties politics winning general elections in nineteen twenty two and nineteen twenty four by promoting themselves as a better bet to stop labour then the still squabbling liberals but losing in nineteen twenty three when they campaigned on tariffs reunited liberal supporters and split the anti socialist vote at that point vitally baldwin and george the fifth accepted labor's right to form a minority government which tried to build a reputation for responsibility with unorthodox mixture of balanced budgets and free trade when the conservatives returned to power less than a year later the desire to inoculate voters against the temptations of socialism ensured that their domestic agenda also included welfare and health reform forms baldwin continued to speak the language of social unity despite the upheaval of the general strike,0

B07CKH6RT8,the introduction if you already know about franchising you think it's an amazing concept you may want to skip the introduction and head directly into the chapters to read about the amazing franchise opportunities presented in this book but if you're curious about why i think franchising is amazing and you want to know more about what's in this book please continue reading the first time a franchiser explain to me how franchising works i thought the concept was amazing after building a successful business a franchise or offers of course for a fee to teach others how to operate the same business in a different location or market amazing and here's why got an amazing idea most people can't come up with a good business idea let alone know how to build a prototype and successfully opened the doors to paying customers most people are going to trip up over where to locate the business are hot and agh associate with suppliers or how to market and advertise the business or how to charge for products or services or how to keep customers coming back time after time or all of that and more in other words most people who start a business are going to fail and they do every year would be business owners lose billions of dollars in america alone all because they didn't know what successful franchisors know the secret is in the system you'll notice that i said successful franchisors because not everyone who becomes a franchise or succeeds but successful franchisors those who invest the time and the money especially the money to build profitable and satisfying businesses also develop a series of systems that they can transfer and teach to other people franchisees everything that successful franchisors know becomes part of a system and it's the system that franchisees rely on to replicate the franchise or success how does mcdonalds eliminate the guesswork about where to open a new unit that knowledge is part of mcdonald's site selection system how does a mcdonald's franchisee know how many hamburger rolls to purchase on any given day and how many employees to scheduled operate the business during an eight hour shift the answers are part of mcdonald's operating system in fact you can't ask a question that mcdonald's the franchiser can't answer about how to operate a successful mcdonald's restaurant and now just imagine mcdonald's is willing to share all of it's knowledge with you or any qualified prospect to become a franchisee anywhere in the world tell me that's not amazing you can minimize the risk what's more amazing and this is what i thought about the first time a franchiser explained franchising to me is that i do not have to come up with a good business idea go into debt to develop the idea in the hopes that it would become a profitable and satisfying business and then fail i don't have to take that risk because there are at least three thousand different franchise opportunities in north of america alone it's easier to find a business concept that i like and then pay the franchise or to teach me how to operate the business successfully in a new location or i can buy an existing franchise business and bypass the more treacherous startup years i didn't come from a business-minded family so i knew very little about how to develop and operate a business and yet i wanted to own a business because i knew that working for someone else wasn't going to fulfill my lifelong expectations i was never going to make enough money working for someone else and i'm not a nine to five type of employee but until i learned about franchising i didn't think i could ever own a business i've since one several franchises i've been the ceo of a major franchise or organization and i've devoted a career to advising franchisors and franchisees writing about franchising and teaching people how to take advantage of this amazing concept franchising is an equaliser through the years i become acquainted with countless people internationally who told me they didn't think they had a chance to own a business because of their circumstances some of these people had great ideas for new businesses but most of them did not have the money to start a business and many of them did not have a formal education one in fact several never graduated from high school no one claimed to know how to build a business but once these people discovered franchising most of their doubts and limitations disappeared over time and they built profitable and satisfying businesses in some cases financial empires it's important to know as successful,1
B07LFJ4VMT,organization function better and create value if you're listening to this i suspect you're after something similar with that definition in mind this book will cover mainstay analytics techniques such as optimization forecasting and simulation as well as more hot topics acts such as artificial intelligence network graphs clustering and outlier detection some of these techniques are as old as world war two others were introduced in the last five years and you'll see that age has no bearing on difficulty or usefulness all these techniques whether or not they're currently the rage are equally useful in the right business context and that's why you need to understand how they work how to choose the right technique for the right problem and how to prototype with them there are a lot of folks out there who understand one or two of these techniques but the rest aren't on their race adar if all i had in my toolbox was a hammer i'd probably try to solve every problem by smacking it real hard not unlike my two year old better to have a few other tools at your disposal but wait what about big data you've heard the term big day data even more than data science most likely is this a book on big data that depends on how you define big data if you defined big data as computing simple summary statistics an unstructured garbage stored in massive horizontally scalable no sql databases then no this is not a book on big data if you define big data as turning transactional business data into decisions and insight using cutting edge analytics regardless of where that data is stored then yes this is a book about big data this is not a book that will be covering database technologies like mongo db and hbase this is not a book that will be covering data science coding packages like my hoot num pi various our libraries and so on there are other books out there for that stuff but that's a good thing this book ignores the tools store porridge and the code instead it focuses as much as possible on the techniques there are many folks out there who think that data storage and retrieval with a little bit of cleanup and aggregation mixed in constitutes all there is to know about big data they're wrong though this book will take you beyond the spiel you've been hearing from the big data software sales reps and bloggers to show you what's really possible with your data and the cool thing is that for many of these techniques your dataset can be any size small or large you don't have to have a petabyte of data and the expense nces that come along with it in order to predict the interests of your customer base if you have a massive dataset that's great but there are some businesses that don't have it needed and will likely never generate it like my local butcher but that doesn't mean his email marketing couldn't benefit from a lick will bacon vs sausage cluster detection if data science books were workouts this book would be all calisthenics no machine weights no ergs once you understand how to implement the techniques with even the most bare bones of tools you'll find yourself free to implement them in a variety of technologies prototype them with ease by the correct data science products from consultants delegate the correct approach to your developers and so on who am i let me pause for a moment to tell you my story it'll go a long way to explaining why i teach data science the way i do many moons ago i was a management consultant i worked on analytics problems for organizations such as the f b i d o d the coca cola company intercontinental hotels group and royal caribbean international and through all these experiences i walked away having learned one thing the more people than just the scientists need to understand data science i worked with managers who bought simulations when they needed an optimization model i worked with analysts who only understood gantt charts so everything needed to be solved with gantt charts as a consultant it wasn't hard to win over a customer with any old white paper and a slick powerpoint deck because they couldn't tell ai from b i or b i from b s the point of this book is to broaden the audience of who understands and can implement data science techniques i'm not trying to turn,1
B01CKBC0P4,author's preface it was only after the consideration of many months and after much self examination as to my motives and after much earnest prayer that i came to the conclusion to write this book i have not taken one single step in the lord's service concerning which i have prayed so much my great dislike to ink greasing the number of religious books would in itself have been sufficient to have kept me forever from it had i not cherished the hope of being instrumental in his way to lead some of my brethren to value the holy scriptures more and to judge by the standard of the word of god the principles on which they act but that which way made more with me than anything was that i have reason to believe from what i have seen among the children of god that many of their trials arise either from want of confidence in the lord as it regards temporal things or from carrying on their business in an unscriptural way an account therefore of the remarkable way in which the lord has dealt with me as to temporal things i feel that i am a debtor to the church of christ and that i ought for the benefit of my poorer brethren especially to make known the way in which i have been led in addition to this i know that to many souls the lord has blessed what i have told them about the way in which he has led me and therefore it seemed a duty to use such means whereby others also with whom i could not possibly converse might be benefited that which induced me finally to determined to write this narrative was that if the lord should permit the book to sell i might buy the profits arising from the sale be enabled in a greater degree to help the poor brethren and sisters among whom i labor a matter which just at that time weighed much on my mind i therefore began to write but after three days i was obliged to lay the workers' side on account of my other pressing engagements subsequently i was laid aside on account of an abscess and being unable for many weeks to walk about as usual though able to work at home i had time for writing when the menu script was nearly completed i gave it to a brother to look over that i might have his judgment and the lord so refreshed his spirit through it that he offered to advance the means for having it printed with the understanding that if the book should not sell he would never consider me his debtor by this offer not a small obstacle was remote moved as i have no means of my own to defray the expense of printing these last two circumstances connected with many other points confirmed me that i had not been mistaken when i came to the conclusion that it was the will of god that i should serve his church in this way the fact of my being a foreigner and therefore but very imperfectly acquainted with the english language i judged to be no sufficient reason for keeping me from writing the christian reader being acquainted with this fact will candidly excuse any inaccuracy of expression for the poor among the brethren this narrative is especially into attended and to their prayers i commended in particular george mueller,0

B06W2G9B8G,in the information sharing has evolved to include the active solicitation of feedback to incorporated increasingly earlier stages of the product cycle many refer to this period as the age of the empowered customer in this audiobook i'll explain how it's also poised to be an age of the marketer this heightened exposure has certainly benefited the customer but it has also benefited those companies that have organized themselves to harness customer feedback to quickly improve their products and services those companies that can meet and exceed customer expectations that is create a great customer experience i have a competitive advantage because marketers play a critical role as a conduit between the customer and the company they are positioned to have a greater role in the business than ever before in fact if they get it right they have an opportunity to serve as the steward of the overall customer experience many marketers are starting to recognize this possibility but few would claim to be close to achieving this stewardship role the truth is there are far more companies that don't get it right if anything they are undermining the customer experience but let's consider for a moment what kinds of customer experiences trigger criticism mm and harsh responses no doubt some of these examples will ring a bell for you the company whose software you use to organize your photos as a major relaunch of its site with no warning and suddenly you can't find all of your photos you visit their community to find that many users are having the same issue but no one seems to have a definitive answer on how the new system works you buy a product from the manufacturer only to have one of it's retailers offer you the same product at a discount a week later you email customer support they are unaware of the promotion and unwilling to offer you a refund you reach out for customer support on twitter go through the process of mutual following so that you can direct message and then explain the issue only to get redirected to another channel where you have to start all over again you research a product online and find some great reviews but you've also spotted some dismal one terms and the company is not responded to the concerns you reach out on social media to hear from the company but they don't respond you visit an online clothing retailer and browse it's entire sweater catalog the company follows up with a series of emails containing offers but none are for sweaters you then pass by one of the company's retail stores on your way to work and discover that there was a storewide sale over the weekend you call one of your phone service providers retail locations to ask if it does handset exchanges in store the representative says yes and tells you to come over but when you arrive you discover there's an hour wait for service the clerk asks for your phone number but then tells you you have to stay in the store in order to keep your appointment when your turn and finally comes up the clerk informs you that in-store exchanges are subject to a restocking fee that does not apply to online exchanges every one of these examples is the result of a failure that is due at least in part to marketing platforms and practices that have not kept pace with innovation and customer expectations they represent a disconnect between marketing and the group responsible for developing the product or service none of these moreover is a small failure because even a single poor customer experience can do long lasting harm to the company's reputation especially if you haven't delivered a particularly great experience in the same period what's more within every one of these examples there are many opportunities for the company to deliver a consistent and great experience that could do differentiated and establish loyalty these are hardly isolated examples many companies suffer from the same flaws comcast is frequently held up as a poster child for customer complaints complaints over customer service billing practices and the customer experience on it's website in fact so long as the list of complaints that there's even a twitter hashtag hashtag comcast outrage where the disgruntled convent at the heart of the complaints is frustration over comcast's approach to it's core service the company forces customers to buy services and bundles that include many items they simply don't want granted this can be an effective way to get customers to try new content but comcast has taken it to such an extreme that it actually infuriates customers the fact is that comcast's approach has for years been out of sync with the market's direction and that is why services like h b o diversified enjoy,1

B009WTRM2E,this book is about broadening your definition of what constitutes effective leadership as we interviewed senior executives and listened to their reactions to the lessons in the book we frequently heard i wished i'd heard these earlier in my career we hope that this book can accelerate your leadership development by removing some of the serendipity that is often required to learn important life lessons we also hope that you will gain a sense of freedom with respect to your role as a leader and understanding that you are not trapped in your current leadership style in fact you have the power to choose alternate ways of thinking acting and behaving in the leadership activities you're responsible for today why should you broaden your definition of leadership in the current climate of intense economic and political uncertainty many thought leaders conceptualize effective organizational leadership in terms of driving mission clarity precise strategy execution and management of extremely complex systems and without a doubt these competencies are crucial for leaders in the twenty first century at the same time we have found that there are consistent demands on leaders to demonstrate greater flexibility in how they respond to rapidly fluctuating circumstances peter f drucker described these demands succinctly leaders require the capacity to analyze to think to weigh alternatives and to harmonize dissent but they also require the capacity for quick and decisive action for boldness and for intuitive courage they require being at home with abstract ideas concepts calculate guns and figures they also require perception of people a human awareness empathy and altogether a lively interest in people and respect for them the purpose of this book is to provide leaders at all levels with a straightforward method to understand their personal leadership equations and more importantly a model to increase their flexibility in navigating beyond their comfort zones of leadership behavior we believe that multi dimensional leaders are more effective in responding to rapidly shifting circumstances than leaders who cling to what they do best the eight dimensions of leadership is based on the disk model of human behavior a system of psychology that helps explain how normal people think feel and act based on the dynamic interplay of four major emotional reactions dominance influence steadiness and conscientiousness the concepts behind disc were articulated in the nineteen twenties by doctor william moulton marston formalized and commercialized in the nineteen seventies by doctor john gyre and further advanced by the inscape publishing research team in part one of the book we introduce you to the eight dimensions of leadership a disk based typologies of leadership styles and provide access to an online assessment to help you determine your primary leadership dimension in part two we explore the common psychological drivers associated with each of the eight dimensions in part three we help you determine what lessons from the eight dimensions might be most relevant to your leadership development at this point in your career we then provide a set of lessons and suggestions to help you increase your flexibility in the dimensions you choose to work on we don't expect you to read part two and part three of the book end to end instead we suggest that you read the chapters that are most relevant to you and come back to the book when circumstances demand a change in your leadership style please note there is available for your download a digital file with figures and tables the eight dimensions of leadership needs assessment and a detailed appendix it's on the web at www dot b k connection dot com slash dimensions,1

B01HDZWM64,the cockpit of an f fourteen is one of the most demanding environments on earth and it's where i learned some of my most unforgettable lessons not just in flying but also in life and in leadership my journey to that cockpit one that began when i decided to pursue a seemingly impossible dream that involve many challenges and trials gave me indispensable insights as well and my path after leaving the military paved largely with my work among business leaders from fortune five hundred executives to middle managers has helped me further distill those lessons share them with others and then watch as leaders and their teams flourish in the years since i've left the navy and began working as a leadership consultant i've been struck again and again by the parallels between the world of naval aviation and the world of business in both leaders must perform highly key complex and high pressure tasks in a constantly changing environment people are counting on you to make the right moves mistakes can result in huge financial losses or damage to your career but no parallel asserted itself more strongly or more or consistently them this one high performing teams require fearless leaders this book is a call for each of us to lead more fearlessly and a guide to show you how to get started it's an encouragement to stand up and excel in situations ones that would provoke fear in anyone whether you're a newbie or a pro it's an invitation to take the principles used by naval aviators to overcome tremendously demanding stressful situations and apply them to your own leadership journey i've seen over and over how the skills nasa necessary to effectively and inspiringly lead a team are lost when we're crippled by individual fears and perceived limitations maybe you have the opportunity to take on a leadership role but don't think of yourself as a leader maybe you're at the helm of a team now but don't feel respected or able to get things done maybe you've been leading for years and are simply looking for a way to do things better maybe you're so fearful of doing something wrong that you find yourself paralyzed stuck in a rut and embracing the status quo because it feels safe no matter your situation then number one way to ensure that are the best leader you can be is to build your ability to work through fear and do what needs to be done in spite of that fear the best leaders stare fear uncertainty and discomfort in the face they push themselves out of their comfort zone zones they aren't content to rest on their laurels ever and they don't make excuses about why they can't take the next step forward on their leadership journey they go in knowing that anything great they want to accomplish will involve fear and discomfort and they decide to go for it anyway with every opportunity they take to stare fear in the face they become stronger more courageous and more confident the ability to work through fear kept me alive as i operated under dangerous conditions and am life or death situations on the flight deck of that aircraft carrier and it's what keeps any leader relevant respected and moving forward if you're able to shape that fear into something useful you'll be on staff bubble letting fear be your copilot is a fundamental element of the art of leading well but just because this book is about fearlessness don't think it's intended only as a remedial work for shrinking violets even if you're doing leadership right you will feel fear no matter how big and bad you are fearless leadership isn't just about dealing with trepidation and anxiety when they come up it's also about seeking out new fears to overcome because you know that doing so will make you a better leader you also don't have to be interested in the military to enjoy and benefit from this book you don't have to wanna fly off fighter jet you don't have to want to be a pioneer of any sort but you do have to be interested in reaching peak performance as a leader whatever that means for you average leaders are everywhere many of them well intentioned and basically competent but this book is and for those who want to land a spot in a comfortable office and hang out there for decades this book is for people who want to step up their game and move to the next level,1

B00IUQENFO,when he arrived at school to pick up his son one afternoon wilder noticed two other cars of the same make and model park next to him on the drive home while their son checked his facebook account remarking hey dad look at this picture of the school parking lot that susan posted it's three cars just like yours why wilder responded that he noticed too and asked what susan had written she says three primary color cars when they got to the stop light wilder looked at the picture surprised to notice that there was a red a yellow and a blue car all primary colors and all the same make and model wilder had noticed three cars where susan and perceive the colors they repainted men and women see the world differently they have different brain chemistry hence have a tendency to process information and respond to words in different ways what motivates a man is not likely to motivate a woman and vice versa this is neither a good thing nor a bad thing just a difference different brains different needs there are numerous examples of gender brain differences but we don't want to bury you with multiple proof points nonetheless we do want to touch on a study done by larry cahill a professor of neurobiology and behavior at the school of biological sciences at the university of california irvine in his research sex related differences in a migdal activity during emotionally influenced memory storage published in november two thousand showed that brains of men and women respond differently to horror films by tracking neural activity of the amygdala located deep in the temporal lobes of the brain behind the eyes and about where your temples are the amygdala controls emotional reactions professor cahill was able to demonstrate that when the male subjects were exposed to a horror film the left side of their amygdala lit up and that side is responsible for accounting for the basics of the event a person is witnessing the essence of the moment when women were exposed to the same scene however the opposite side of the unmake de la fired the right side of the magdalena is in charge of the details of the moment the results might be that when a couple sits in a theater watching a scary movie the boyfriend is thinking about what the characters should be doing to get out of the house clear the threat and escape to safety the girlfriend on the other hand he is noticing that the distribution of the blood splatter that was on the left side of the actor's face as in the previous scene has suddenly switch sides due to an editing error all the while simultaneously trying to figure out how to clear the threat and escape to safety different responses by gender to the same stress the same information make it evident that although the same general area of the brain is engaged the location utilized varies so the reactions are different communication is a haphazard endeavor at the best of times what's said and heard are rarely the same thing as few individuals are fully engaged in any given conversation yet in times of stress it degrades even farther for example when a group of nurses or orderlies in a mental hospital has to physically restrain a patient who has gotten out of control they often use physical cues as well as words to communicate with each other not only do they get commands like move over i can help but also they get a tap or a push as well the reason for this multi layered communication is an attempt to circumvent the adverse impact of adrenalin stress can cause a loss of fine motor skills such as finger dexterity complex motor skills such as hand eye coordination and depth perception under extreme conditions people experience hyper vigilance loss of rational thought memory loss and inability to consciously move or react but fortunately most of us do not have to deal with such situations it is important to note however that male and female adrenal dumps work differently men experience a rapid spike and quick fall off where adrenaline takes much longer to kick in for women and falls off much more slowly this means that among other things,1
B07K8X8P3F,hi i'm eric greece an engineer by training and now an entrepreneur i've been the founder of startups that have succeeded and that have failed and some that are still evolving i've also had the privilege to act as a mentor or coach for organizations of all kinds and sizes ranging from small startups to major corporations and even the federal government that work came about after i wrote my first book the lean startup which laid out a theory for building and growing startups based on a simple cycle of build measure learn i also wrote a second book called the startup away which is about how large often slow corporations can use lean startup practices to transform into nimble flexible twenty first century companies what you're listening to right now is not really like either of those this is not a work of theory it's not a deep dive into management trends or historical cases it's simply a practical nuts and bolts guide for how to implement lean startup in your organization it was born out of the consulting work i was doing with two kinds of clients corporate and startup both of whom are going through transformational change transformation often feels like you're founding the company all over again whether it's ten or a hundred years old think about a startup that doubling and tripling in size over the course of a few years the vast majority of employees were not there in the early days they never saw first hand what we in silicon valley call the hockey stick that's our euphemism for exponential change and they probably didn't found a hyper growth startup themselves they're likely to bring habits and beliefs from traditional companies right into the startup i would work with people at different levels of these companies executives and boards and teams and they would all ask the same things how do we get our leaders to think in this new way how do we change how we hold them accountable and get them to hold their teams accountable and they define leaders very broadly in a way that surprised me the founders see themselves as leaders of course but they also see their teams that work for them the managers the founders of internal startups and their executives as leaders were responsible for a team of thousands or just themselves each needed to be empowered and held account apple for instituting a new vision my job was to help each of my clients build new frameworks for innovation internally and help them create new business models without risking their company's existing foundation i found ways to do this using materials like case studies workshop plans and detailed documentation i helped them understand the mic panics of have do lean startup experiments and reviews in every area from product development to marketing to transforming the company's internal processes like legal finance and i t from departments that held innovation back to ones that supported it,1

B00CWG6T8W,again and again an enlightened and strong willed individual has pushed against the prevailing trends and the prevailing wisdom to perform an act of courage that has changed history paul johnson needed leaders of courage forbes may seventh two thousand and seven leaders make decisions that make events happen obviously there is more to the definition of leadership as tyrants do the same and they are not leaders many books on leadership offer success stories as a way of saying this is leadership and this is what i did to achieve it unfortunately those books do not clarify that success alone does not equal leadership some of the authors also imply that all of the steps they took toward their success are now necessary for others to follow in many cases some of their actions had nothing to do with their receiving an honor or a position as ceo of a company effective leadership can be taught this book focuses on the essential elements of true leadership think of it as identifying the critical dna of leadership akin to the twenty per cent of the dna of a human genome that accounts for the characteristics of the individual the other eighty percent being junk dna or noncoding dna here in this book or a set of proven simple to follow steps to becoming a leader and achieving success through essential principles taken from my personal experiences and observations this starts from acknowledging that success and leadership are not the same identity five ways of avoiding or overcoming such roadblocks as wasted effort false starts and disappointments and i'll illustrate each of these principles with an example of people who have demonstrated exceptional qualities courage persistence intelligence strength of character etc through their actions their personal philosophies or their writings many of these leaders personally shared with me their definition of leadership for this book and these exemplary figures together helped to set standards for anyone who aspires to a leadership position along with an analysis of practical methods or strategies of leadership each chapter ends with a list of lessons learned highlighting what i'd like you to take away from reading each chapter as i explain in chapter one before and after hurricane katrina state and local officials were exposed as too incompetent or too weak to confront critical problems and make life saving decisions understandably leadership ability was in the forefront of the minds of louisiana voters in the two thousand and seven guba editorial election and it certainly ought to be on the minds of american voters in all presidential and congressional elections the twenty first century has shown that terrorism can make our own corner of the world a dangerous place democracy and liberty thrive when we identify true leaders and nurture potential ones i encourage you to read and enjoy the book to pursue leadership skills and to seek out true leaders our survival yours and mine may depend on it second edition this second edition adds two chapters that give examples of individuals who are poised to lead our country in overcoming the challenges of government spending and debt entitlement and security america now faces the first additional chapter demonstrates leadership in action by louisiana governor bobby jindal and the disastrous gulf oil spill the second new chapter confirms what i said in the epilogue of the first edition namely that americans were disgusted and apathetic with the performance of those in congress but dramatic events occurred since the first edition and the apathy has turned into activism the spontaneous emergence of activists loose sli connected under the tea party name resulted in voting in two thousand and ten that shifted the balance of power in the us house of representatives now we can watch history unfold and see if real change occurs or a repeat of the recent past of arrogance and self serving legislators who pass bills that create rather than solve problems yes we watch and wait for leadership in america for a return to the principles of the declaration of independence and the u s constitution that gave us the greatest land of liberty in the history of the world,1
B005VSTOD0,strong performers and laggards all carlyle needed to do with suitable privacy precautions was to connect these enormous databases shake them together and see what patterns emerged within a few months carlyle had his answers on the question of childhood familiarity with computers google co-founder sergey brin turned out to be right people who grew up as early adopters of technology tended to be unusually creative adults in new uncharted realms most other supposed markers of success turned out to be mirage says when all the number crunching was done several dozen factors including a few real oddities emerged as ones that could help predict candidate's chances the biggest impact of carlyle's experiment however transcended any single hiring shortcut what google learned was that it had been looking at candidates resumes for far too narrowly fast-growing google had started out by focusing inordinately on candidate's education grade point averages and even as a t scores the thinking was that high i q people would do best at google and that the best way of gauging brain power was to look at candidates classroom record google ended up with lots of phd holders from stanford mit caltech and top ivy league schools but by the time carlyle got to work there was lingering unease that some of these geniuses weren't quite as effective as google had hoped even more important company insiders worried that they might be turning away a lot of talented people whose true abilities surpassed their academe mc credentials take the wide view became the overriding lesson of carlisle's experiment transcripts and scores alone weren't the full measure of a candidate there was room at google for people whose grades had faltered because they were working thirty hours a week to pay for college there was room for highly competitive people who had chased athletic dream when they were younger and now we're applying that same relentless energy to professional goals there was room especially in non engineering fields for people who weren't great students but who had been running businesses tutoring volunteering and otherwise being civic leaders from their teenage days onward such candidates would stay in va visible if google rigidly scan resumes the traditional way from top to bottom as many as seventy five thousand resumes a week streamed into google's offices so many candidates chased so few openings that if reviewers didn't see some wow factor right away it was time to hit the reject button the best hope of spotting these hidden winners carlyle came to believe was to steal a quick peek at the bottom of the resume that's where he might find out that someone had competed in four alaska marathons or had made it into the guinness book of world records or had published three software manuals by age twenty five for the right job a b those weren't peripheral details they might be powerful insights into someone's character or on the job potential so carlisle stopped reading resumes the usual way he became known as the man who analyzed resumes upside down now when carlyle pulls up a resume on his laptop which tends to happen dozens of times a day he begins by tapping the page down key a couple of times until he reaches the final entries then he scrutinizes the loose ends of candidates bio those i want to know their stories carlisle explained to me one morning i want to know what these people are all about in a moment he might scroll back to the top and start hunting for the classic markers of competence work history education credentials and the like but first he wanted to see if some special rare attribute could poi the way to greatness this is a book about people with the audacity to do what carlisle did to read resumes upside down and why their approaches are so important to america's future over the past thirty years i have been interviewing hundreds of people who wrestle with the same challenges that google faced they may be working at army bases ad agencies in investment banks hollywood studios big industrial companies medical schools corporate boardrooms college admissions offices speakers bureaus or nanny agencies no matter what they're calling they are all consumed by the same few questions how do we spot rare talent how do we know it's real how do we avoid walking right past some of the best candidates we will ever see without even recognizing our oversights those questions have been tantalizing and tormenting managers for a long time but here's the fascinating twist over the past few decades we as a society have made talent spotting vastly more sophisticated than it ever was before personal hunches have yielded to an endless stream of manuals and seminars on line job boards offer thousands of candidates,1

B006JS8IJW,the other jumpers do not possess i'd want to talk about that in fact in a few moments i'm going to share with you thirteen ways to start winning from the inside out and it's just going to it this is a life changing lecture now before i do that though let's go to this many times when people talk about winning they ask the wrong questions in fact there are two things i i hear constantly when people talk about winning and i want to always jump up give them a timeout signal and say wait a minute this has nothing to do with winning for example wrong question number one what are the conditions i run at all kinds of people who they'll say well before i can say what i'm going to win or not what are the conditions for example if they're in a sporting event or something like we just talked about they're going to want to know is it away is the game away or is at home do i have the home field advantage or they'll want to say how's the weather if it's going to be outside is whether it's going enough playing football is going to be cold gold is it going to be rainy in other words there are a lot of people that are they base their their ability to win on the conditions around them or if it's about life itself they'll say well no wonder i'm not winning you don't understand i have a bad family background if you have been born when i was born if you'd have been born where i was born or if you'd had been born to whom i was born two then you would understand why i can't win in other words if they are condition oriented and they basically say i have not done this because the conditions won't allow me to do it now does this make sense how many times do we find people olympian around basically saying the conditions weren't right wrong question let me stop here long enough for those who got had this tape listen to me my friend if you're not winning it is not because your conditions are wrong just remember that the second wrong question that that is that as many times as if they're not asking what are the conditions that segues they ask all the time is who is the competition in other words they're saying well no wonder i'm not winning there are other people out here that are quicker faster better smarter whatever and they're always worried about the competition now i've always be an admirer of john wooden who was for many years the successful basketball coach for the cla bruins and who probably set a record in college basketball that that will not be repeated and i think he had eight straight n c double a final championships i don't imagine thereby ever beating that record now let me tell you something interesting about john wooten because i've read about as much as i can ever find about his life that is one of my provocations i have a basketball signed by him in my office john wooden never scouted the opposition in fact at where all the college coaches were always out there with their scouts watching the teams are going to play a down the line john wooden didn't even have an official scout for the cla roads are they ask him about they said why don't you have somebody check it out these other teams and john wooden said my biggest problem is not the other team my bigger the problem is us and if i can get us prepared right to play up to our potential it doesn't matter who we play you see winning is an inside job always has been always will be and for those who are looking for outward conditions or another competitor to it's going to come and steal their victory away i'm here to tell you you're looking in the wrong place now what i love about this lesson today and why i think it's so effective is this i'm going to share with you in a minute thirteen ways to start winning on the inside what i love about this lesson is every one of you in this room and every person listen to this tape can do all thirteen now think about it for a moment i'm not going to give you anything you can't do i'm not going to put anything so high that you can't reach it in fact this lesson is what i call a lower shelf lesson everything's on a low shelf you can reach up and help yourself if you want to now while you do it that's your choice that's not my choice i'm responsible to you not for you i'm responsible to teach you principles that can change your life then you're responsible to change your life i'm not responsible change your life don't make me i'm responsible changed my life not yours are you with me so what you gotta understand i'm going to lay it out here for you just reach up you pick it and you can you could do all thirteen if you want to if you want to you don't have to any thirteen you can lose all your life and wonder why or what most losers do blame someone else for your losing but i'm here to tell you that every one of you can pick this up now here's what else i love about this not only can every one of you do what i'm about to share for you to do that will help you become a winner on the inside which will make you a winner on the outside by the way you know how you become winner on the outside is by being a winner on the inside winning inside is always your first victory then you can begin

B07HNGH26T,have a bias towards action creating valuable content at a faster rate starts with a mind set shift in my breakthrough success podcast interview with eo fire host john lee dumas we touched upon taking action in part of a conversation that was focused on building a a podcasting empire it was at this moment that jail d emphasized having a bias towards action during our interview he explained having a bias towards action by saying so many people trick themselves into thinking that they need to wait for the perfect moment to happen you need to have a bias towards action not be afraid to make mistakes just do things that scare you and get you out of the comfort zone and see where the chips will fall from there that to me is the key to success awful and trump enters the same individual who makes six figures every month from podcasting believes that a bias towards action is the key to successful and trump enters you will make mistakes along the journey everyone does with that said if you are willing to go out of your comfort zone and turn an action into your default choice crafting viable concept will become an easier task that evolves into a fun activity batch your content production during that same interview of jail deep he discussed how he batches his content production basically he he does all thirty interviews for his podcast over a two day period and gets interviewed on twenty podcasts on one day this approach gives him twenty seven days to focus on other tasks first content brant ever since jail dimension the content batching method i've noticed more and more people mentioned this is similar to when you buy a new car model and suddenly notice many of those car models on the road and actually there's even a name for this phenomena is called the baader meinhof phenomenon in case you're in the mood for a new trivia question all you may know about content bashing is that jailed he does it but it's a secret to consistently creating valuable content with ease notice how jailed he only spent two days each month interviewing people firs eo fire episodes he also saw pence only one day getting interviewed for other podcasts while he takes on the herculean mission to consistently publish one new episode every day he's only working towards his herculean mission for two days each month if you could grind for two days and then have all of your content created completed and scheduled for that month would you do it and since most people don't publish daily podcast episodes that content batching process is much easier for most of us if you write one blog post every other week and choose two days of the month to write ten blog posts per day you've got content schedule as for almost the entire year now i only recommend this approach if you have a solid promotional talent are in place and even then you should still leave some holes in your schedule so you can insert new blog post due to videos or podcast episodes in case there is breaking news in industry and for some niches every day presents big news to get started with your content batching plant choose a day of the week your conduct your content bashing for instance you can choose tuesdays to patrick content you can also choose to exclusively patrick content on the first tuesday of the month the options available for your content batching are dependent on your schedule and the time you can commit to crafting valuable content central have the ideas written in advance based on what you learn from chapter one you won't get held back by a lack of ideas,1
B01AIZ1CDA,new music coming out nothing happened that night i chatted to friends tidy the house a little and went to bed thinking that the most noteworthy thing to have occurred was ruby sleeping life continued as usual for a couple of weeks and i thought no more about my new friend vic but after a while he sent me a message on chat one night thanking me for accepting his request and saying that he hoped i could support the charity work he was involved in it wasn't a terribly personal message and it certainly didn't set off any alarm bells i looked into vic's page a bit further than i had originally i learned that he was part of a collective of four dj's who called themselves street beats they toured the world doing gigs and then donated the money they made from their shows back into street beats which they had set up themselves the aim was to help street and orphaned kids in zimbabwe the charity didn't have any religious or political affiliation it was just there to help kids who were either existing in shantytowns or who had nowhere to stay and lived rough their stories were awful about forty percent live below the poverty line and one in ten children didn't go to school there was a huge problem with sexual exploitation of kids and trafficking was a growing issue there were so many other problems i read that the police were often violent even to children on the streets that torture was used by some groups that minority children faced even more discrimination and abuse it seemed such a worthy cause as i thought of ruby my heart went out to those of the children who had none of the love or privileges she had we might not be rich but she would never face a life like that the dj's did session work production and all sorts of other music based professional work with well known singers and bands it seemed like they really put their hearts into it and raised a great deal of money vic was obviously enthusiastic about it though and no pictures of any of the dj's on the site and vic exp plane that they had a strict rule of no media coverage saying that they were in the game to raise money for the charity that they weren't interested in any of the celebrity stuff he was a funny guy and often made me laugh when we were talking online he called me miss henley a lot and joked about everything and anything frequently awards the collective had one were announced on their facebook page mtv awards and things like that but i respected the way that he didn't play the fame game when vick wasn't on tour he lived in a truck in south wales he told me he had romany gypsy roots and had never lived in a house it all sounded sublime i would have loved a life of music and being on the road but it wasn't likely now that i had responsibilities he was a bitter face of about some of his family history but that was fair enough i was almost a complete stranger to him after all some things best left unsaid said he told me families can be funny things vic got in touch a few times to tell me more of the work he was doing one night i casually mentioned quite truthfully that it was a great cause and asked him how he had decided to start it all up it was as if i'd opened up a flood of memories for him in previous messages vic had been chatty and friendly but it had all been fairly superficial which was understandable given that we didn't know each other now i seemed to have asked the question which went to the very heart of him i find this hard to talk about don't say anything i'm sorry i replied really i didn't mean to pry no you're not prying he said it's just a very raw subject for me it turned out that his whole life and career were based on a heartbreaking accident vick's little boy zach had died run over by a car on a traveler's site when he was less than two years old zack's mom was meant to be looking after him but she was drunk or drugged at the time according to vic and her next agents had cost the poor child his life i'll never forgive myself he said she was in charge of him but i should never have let that happen are too busy trying to give her a bit responsibility and zach paid the price she had no interest in keeping him safe she had no interest in anything apart from what came out of a bottle or went up her nose i regret to my dying day that i didn't put my foot,0
B00KFK3V42,my trip to louisiana was more wonderful than i could have imagined i spent the next couple of weeks trying to come down for all my triumph i knew that this wasn't going to last i was in college there were parties going on all the time girls were throwing themselves at me i was denying myself for someone who lived hundreds of miles away in carson was never going to yield completely to my lifestyle and i wasn't ready for the perfect dream home i wanted adventure i had something to prove i hadn't denied carson i just needed to get on with my own life after putting my books away and getting ready for bed thoughts of carson were dancing in my head it was too late to call her so i savoured our memories her wildness seems so extreme because she was always playing with a net she knew that she could fall and not experience any real heart her melancholy was temporary and never enough to get her to turn her back on her southern dream i had to admit that i wasn't ready to put aside my career plans and for me there were so much more i felt that i was more willing to venture into the unknown i marshalled all my skills whether in sports or music to find an experience that had never been tried with all the fun that surrounded me i was a little slow to test the waters my time in destiny really affected me deeply it wasn't like carson and i made a deep promise to each other but i felt that if i pursued another girl then i might lose carson for good as much as our trip to louisiana reminded me how deep my feelings still were for carson it also forced me to be realistic the winter storm intervene to hold us in mandeville little longer but there it would be no such intervention to keep us together permanently as we drove back to athens i felt the distance between us growing more and more if our experience hadn't been so intense i might have expected less perhaps we could have worked something out but our passion said all or nothing i was getting closer to admitting that our time together there was only a potent memory i understood that i was rationalizing our separation one minute i was ready to throw her over forget another i wouldn't let her go for the world even if i adopted a plan with regards to carson i knew that i couldn't stick to it once and for all this wasn't the same thing is taking a history elective carson only had to invite me to a new meeting place and i would be off in a second if we loved each other nothing could really separate us on the other hand we were living almost a half continent away that should have been reason enough to let it go once and for all love couldn't conqueror lol i promised that i wouldn't engage in some abstract debate with myself if i was in athens and if there was a party to attend i wasn't going to say no thanks happen when you're young i was a guy full of energy and i wasn't going to restrain myself for a fantasy sure carson was real as could be but we were never going to live together and we weren't going to get married either it was simple i was going to live one day at a time i would pay tribute to athens when i was in georgia and i would pay tribute to carson when i was in louisiana and if carson happened to visit me then i would show her the best damn time that i could i wouldn't even think twice about it no matter what happen we would always be friends and deep down we would both wish that it could be different the next time that carson and i met in mandeville i could sense that things were starting to change between us the love was still there but it was no longer as wondrous as i once felt it we were both growing older i could no longer pretend that the fact that we live so far apart didn't created distance between us i still thought that our love was one of the most important things in my life but i no longer felt as if i could slay dragons i didn't want to give up on my romantic dream i cherished a desire in my heart and carson gratified my deepest longing the night have our first meeting could not have been more legendary i wanted to believe that the whole world still felt the tremors from that kiss if poetry could somehow still that wonder i only hope that someone would have the eloquence to communicate our splendor even now her kisses had the power to renew my most profound aspirations when i held her close i wanted to tell myself that this was forever but i can no longer trust in the illusion i cherish the present for what it was i realized that we were gradually drifting apart,0
B002V8LLS4,though his picture hadn't seemed in sync with the daily news out of iraq with a steady frequency bombs were going off killing americans in baghdad and beyond and any time the iraqis announced they would expand training for the iraqi police or military those registration drives were being met with gunfire or suicide car bombers so in late two thousand and three we decided to go to baghdad and see for ourselves had we known iraq was set to collapse into all out war we might not have gone at all but that's irrelevant now for the two of us red sox fans to the point of painful cliche the road to baghdad started in the south bronx more specifically in section three thirty six of yankee stadium on the night of october seventeenth two thousand and three game seven of the american league championship series or lcs the stadium as yang the fans call it is known as the toilet by red sox fans since as seen from above resembles a giant commode on this night the usual antipathy between these two sets of fans was amplified by tied up series both the red sox and the yankees had won three games after the red sox won game six to tie and force it decisive game seven the team had their best hope for a world series in seventeen years compounding the anticipation game seven was to showcase the greatest postseason pitching duel in decades current red sox ace pedro martinez vs former red sox ace roger clemens from new jersey to maine every media outlet hyped game seven as more than a mere athletic event in new york the headlines read things like showdown in the bronx and do or die on that day across the northeast corridor regular life simply stop for millions of people including us all everyone cared about was the eight seventeen pm game time after a few hours of trying we scored tickets at the last minute nothing beats october baseball in the northeast the traditional red white and blue bunting was unfurled around the mezzanine and box seats then the sun slipped from the bronx sky and the night grew cold we could see our breath as yankee stadium began to fill and everybody in the place remained standing as pedro and roger walked out of their bullpens to do long toss warm ups in the outfield by the time of the national anthem with it's f sixteen flyover we had butterflies in our stomachs which we were trying to quell with several seven dollar beers as we mingled among the new york faithful it didn't take long for us to stop getting harassed by yankee super fans with their wind suited sat and jacketed bottom being humor a buster what's boston ever won no yo life was great the red sox took an early lead knocking clemens out of the game and holding their edge behind a steady pager on the mound soon we became magnets for showers of tri-state saliva and thrown beers and we're celebrating high fiving with any red sox fans we could find talk was already circulating between us about who would be driving the first leg of the tour rip to miami for game one of the two thousand and three world series against the marlins sticky van are trusted old friend a classic white ford f one fifty cargo van that we often slept in only to awaken stuck to the floor was our ride of choice as it had been on so many cross country adventures before in anticipation in a victory we gathered with our friends and other red sox fans on the left field lower deck where we were provided our own somewhat abusive police detail then things went wobbly not long after our route to miami was planned a hard charged on i ninety five as the world series would start in two days the yankees rallied to tie the game and the rest well sucks in the bottom of the eleventh aaron boone blasted a game winning home run into the left field stands only a few yards from us we may even stick around long enough to see captain gt's emerged from the yankee dugout to do his patented victory chap on a ride home down the fdr tears were flowing we were broken drought owning our sorrows with bourbon at a bar in the east village we contemplated our future or fresh lack thereof we had no regular jobs nor were we looking for any we weren't done with school and we weren't getting any younger at about three a m i turned to jeff and said bad as this feels it isn't bad at all it's an opportunity to make some decisions makes new plans i had no plans beyond the world series you know i hate thinking ahead the next afternoon we woke up in our brooklyn loft and retreated to our rooftop refuge our buildings old unused water tower had been converted by an artist into a sitting area with two comfy wooden benches and it offered the best view of manhattan for miles below us was a major sanitation depot and the sea sweet smell of garbage in transit filled the air a scrawny crackhead hooker trolled the street below despite the benches and the views at the moment our loft seemed to rank among the most unlivable places in america the nearby stores were often out of everything that hadn't been canned or bottled by goya a twenty minute walk walk would get you to the nearest health food store we sat on the roof nursing our hangovers with a few beers must we endure another painful winter jeff said i can't i have to leave new york the whole east coast america even i'm over it i dunno maybe go to the middle east it's pretty boring there right now jeff like to live in a place be it boston new york or california for a few months only to fail at whatever he was trying to do and then pack his bags for an international destination the prior winter a humbled jeff had retreated from the city after dropping out of the school of visual arts in midsummer easter now i plan on joining him as a new york failure another trade huh i think i'll be joining in on this one i said fuck you the middle east was my idea it was common for us to argue about who thought of what first asshole i've been saying i wanted to go to the middle east all summer and you know it neither of us spoke we stared at the endlessly interesting manhattan skyline airplanes were cruising above the city i can't believe the sox lost imagine how many shirts we've sold in cars we'd flipped the world series was in boston no shit since nineteen ninety nine the red sox had provided me with a decent income not to mention a lot of jeffs back in the summer of ninety nine i'd been a vendor inside fenway park selling cokes in the stands during games that october the red sox had faced the yankees in their first ever lcs matchup when tj just hours after the series was set a friend and i silkscreened the words yankees suck on a white t-shirt in a blue athletic bold font the night before game one we sold three hundred shirts between the hours of one am and three a m to fans camped out at fenway awaiting the sale of tickets from that night on yankees suck t shirts have been sold outside fenway after every home game along with later iterations that read things like w w j d d what would johnny damon do yankee suck jeter swallows jeter sucks a ride or other similarly pithy phrases we could generate beyond all the other t-shirts though the yankees suck sure to become in their way famous gaining mentioned in sports illustrated the new york times the new yorker and dozens of other national publications most games we had roughly twenty people selling shirts on the sidewalks and street corners around fenway generally they were old friends or younger brothers of old friends work consists of standing and hawking shirts for an hour after games the t-shirt operation wasn't a normal business with profit is the bottom line for us the bottom line was fun with a nightly suck of our gross profit going toward collective good times the money gave us the freedom to do things like traveling on a whim or attending big playoff game james i'd actually met jeff in nineteen ninety six outside wetlands a now shuttered barn club downtown in new york city back when i was still in high school then it would seem around at music shows up and down the east coast growing up jeff mostly lived in the greater washington d c area including arlington and farther south in richmond virginia when we met he was living in northwest washington d c working as a bicycle messenger and playing guitar and a few bands he picked up his global travel habit with these bands touring gave him a chance to see europe south america and the pacific rim plus a good chunk of north america in nineteen ninety eight he moved to boston to make a new start and remove himself from what had become a negative environment a situation that culminated with a long jail sentence for his best friend and his long time girlfriend leaving him for a guy who loved penny loafers and had greaser hair in boston he promptly enrolled in then dropped out of northeastern university where i was also enrolled as a student college kids in boston have two major enclaves the mission hill area of roxbury near northeastern and lower austin near boston university neither of these neighborhoods can be described as nice though the hill is the slightly more dangerous of the two i'd moved to boston as a student from my family's home north of the city and nine eighteen ninety seven the year before jeff arrived permanently we lived in similar mission hill triple decker apartments our circle of friends was drawn from the various colleges in town as well as from the music scene we'd both grown up in,0

B002V0QOIO,the probe deeper to focus on the particular rather than the general and to uncover as much as i could about what it was like for ordinary people to live and die in these momentous years therefore i decided to try to tell the story of a great pestilence from the perspective of the inhabitants of a single village the place i chose was walsham le willows a large rural parish in northwest suffolk that possesses exceptionally good local records which run continuously through the crucial years from the mid thirties forties to thirteen fifty but as i began to work on the book it soon became clear why nothing like this had ever been done before even in the best documented of places the sources surviving from the fourteenth century are silent or severely deficient on most of the issues that were central to the lives of the villagers there are no diaries reminiscences or correspondence and no accounts of what people believed or how they spent their days in fact there is scarcely any truly personal information on the vast majority of men and women who lived at the time for they were illiterate and their rulers and bettors were not concerned to write much about them thus despite being of exceptional quality for the period washrooms sources fall far short of enabling the historian adequately to explore the experiences of it's inhabitants during the black death as a result any conventional historical account which has written about this village or any other village for that matter rather than being comprehensive and intimate will inevitably be selective and impersonal historians seeking to write an intimate social history of the great pestilence will find themselves constantly thwarted by the lack of evidence instead of writing the story they might seek to tell they will have their focus set by the very different priorities and motives of the fourteenth century clerks and administrators who compiled the records while we would wish to discover what the people who lived and died in these tumultuous years experienced heard thought did and believed even the very best sauces the local court records tell us primarily about such matters as the straying of sheep and cows the failure to repay debts the obstructions which careless or selfish villagers left in the way of paths and water causes the poaching of rabbits the election of villagers to memorial offices or the buying selling and inheritance of plots of land and what is more they rarely do so in other than brief and formulaic language pieces of information like this of course capture an essential part of the routine of royal society and they can occasionally be supplemented by notices of deaths marriages and illegitimate births but much of the world in which walsham villagers lived is left in deep impenetrable shadow local records tell us frustratingly little in a direct manner about the impact of the black death the intimate history of the black death as it was witnessed by those who experienced it was never recorded yet it would be wrong to suggest that the fourteenth century is poorly documented rather it's relatively abundant archives cast their light in other places there are multitudes of records which illuminate significant areas of the religious political legal and economic affairs of the time although the vast mage majority of them relate to the affairs of nations and to major occurrences in the world at large all were created by the bureaucracies of institutions and deal with administrative processes such archives support the writing of macro histories or provide wondrous detail on such matters as the income and expenditure of blade households or the performance of the great farms of the rich but they are largely silent on the micro histories of ordinary people such a state of affairs is not uncommon for throughout history institutions have generated the bulk of filament paper while daily living and individual lives have left little or no trace the absence of personal information is particularly acute in the middle ages where the sources simply do not survive which would enable even partial biographies of the great mass of ordinary folk who dwelled in villages and towns to be reconstructed the same is true of religion which was of immense importance to fourteenth century society a considerable amount is known about the english church and the organization and operation of dioceses and parishes,0
B003UDDK7O,five chapter one good as the enemy of great that's what makes death so hard unsatisfied curiosity beryl markham west with the night good is the enemy of great and that's one of the key reasons why we have so little that becomes truly great we don't have great schools principally because we have good schools we don't have great government principally because we have good government few people attain great lives in large part because it is so easy to just settle for the goodlife the vast majority of companies never become great precisely because the vast ms she already become quite good and therein lies much of their main problem this became piercingly clear to me in nineteen ninety six when i was having dinner with a group of thought leaders gathered for a discussion about organizational performance bill meehan who ran the san francisco office of mckinsey and company leaned over his salad and casually confided you know jim we love built to last around here you and your co co-author jerry porous did a very fine job on the research and writing unfortunately it's useless i asked him to explain the companies you wrote about and built to last were for the most part always great bill me and said they never had to turn themselves from good companies integrate companies they had parents like david packard and george merck who shaped the character of greatness from early on but what about the vast majority of companies that wake up partly through life and realise hey we're good we're not great i now realize that meehan was exaggerating for effect with his useless comment but his essential observation action was correct truly great companies for the most part have always been great and the vast majority of good companies remain just that good but not great indeed means comment proved to be an invaluable gift as it planted the seed of a question that became the basis of this entire book namely can a good company become a great company and if so how can good become great or is the disease of just being good incurable five years after that fateful dinner in writing this manuscript we could say without question that good degrade does happen and we've learned much about the underlying variables that make it happen inspired by bill man's challenge my research team and i embarked on a five year research effort a dj journey to explore the inner workings of good to great now to quickly grasp the concept of the project i want you to picture a diagram now you might be driving somewhere you might be sitting at a desk you might be running on the treadmill but i want you to fix this picture in your brain and want you to picture a stock chart that is broken into two halves on the left half it's just going sideways right is just absolutely horizontal totally flat waffling to the side and then there's a punctuation pointer a pivot point and bang after a period of time it starts to rise and climb and climb and climb and climb and climate climb so the left side of the page flat right side of the page climbing climbing climbing at about a forty five degree angle and unlike in a picture a second curve witches a curve that tracks the flat curve for the first half of the page but then in comparison to when the good to great curve shoots upward this second curve continues to go sideways in other words we were looking at companies that showed the top pattern good performance to great performance in contrast to other companies that showed good performance and never made it to great performance more precisely we identified company that made the leap from good results to great results and sustained those results for at least fifteen years we then compared these companies to a carefully selected control group of comparison companies that failed to make that leap or if they did make a leap they failed to sustain it we then compared the guy good to great companies to the comparison companies to discover the essential and distinguishing factors at work the good to great examples that made the final cut into the study attained extraordinary results during the years of their leap averaging cumulative stock returns six point nine times the general market in the fifteen years following their transition point to put that in perspective g e or general electric considered by many to be the best lead company in america at the end of the twentieth century outperformed the market by two point eight times over the fifteen year,1

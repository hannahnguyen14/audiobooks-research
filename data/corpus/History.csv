B00F8JE9ZA,our nation and the world breathed a sigh of relief upon learning president kennedy had miraculously avoided the bullets targeting him in dallas but that feeling was overshadowed by an almost unthinkable fact someone had tried to murder our president that thought proved to be so unnerving that country music populace jimmy dean scored a december nineteen sixty three instant hit with his upbeat ballad the day jfk dodged a bullet the phrasing fit right in with the mythos that had been so carefully cultivated since a young brave pt boat officer named john f kennedy began seeking office almost twenty years earlier it was a way to see the unnerving current circumstances as proof of the president's charmed life rather than a shattering of our own national calm as the events broke that day however there was fear and confusion among all the president's men working in his white house many of their stories of shock and panic in dallas have been told now but other accounts have been lost in the fog of conspiracy we know the number of bullets but continue to argue about who fired them and from where we also know that their intended target president kennedy quickly recovered from his minor injuries and sprang into action in retrospect it is clear that within the first hour after the event both the president of the united states and the attorney general felt the government they represented was under siege and their civilian authority was in serious jeopardy how they came to that conclusion and what they said to those working in the white house in those first days set the stage for an epic confrontation dealey plaza has the presidential motorcade turned into dealey plaza secret service special agent clinton j hill did not like what he saw to the left or the president's car was an open landscaped area at the western hand of downtown dallas hill riding on the left running board of the follow up car he felt his stomach tightened at the sight of so much open space on the right he saw the texas school book depository toward which the president was waving hill glanced up the building's higher floors the bodyguards reflex change the course of history a glint of metal in the midday sun flashed from a window on the sixth floor it is not clear whether hill saw only the rifle barrel or also perhaps the man who was holding it either way there was no time to look only to act he launched himself from the running board of his own vehicle and sprinted toward the president's car screaming go go as he leapt on the trunk and scrambled forward the driver secret service special agent william greer inexplicably had hesitated and nearly slowed to a stop a reaction opposite from what he had been trained to do hills screamed greer now greer mashed his foot down on the gas swerving out of his lane in an evasive pattern even as he did multiple shot were fired seemingly from a variety of directions according to numerous witnesses the presidential motorcade had entered what would come to be called the kill zone hill was the agent assigned to the first lady but in an instant like this he was trained to cover the president particularly when he saw that the agent in the passenger seat roy kellerman whose job it was to protect the president was frozen just as greer initially had been hill tried to push the president down but kennedy's body was stiff he wouldn't bend even under hills muscle the secret service agent instantly readjusted so he could move both president kennedy and the first lady into prone positions across the seat be supper courted his body over them with both arms the president by his own testimony under oath before his interrogators of the u s senate trial screamed jesus christ they're trying to kill all of us his advisers kenneth o'donnell and dave powers reacted similarly o'donnell was j f k's appointment secretary and political sounding board and powers was the president's longtime close friend because of their white house importance the two men were riding in the car immediately behind kennedy and they too felt they were being targeted from at least two directions and that everyone was going to die agent hill was hit twice one bullet shattering his spinal cord and the the other ripping through his left temple the amateur film of dallas resident abraham zapruder caught the action including a spray of blood and brains that appeared to knock hill's head back and to the left for many observers the headshot did seem to indicate that at least one bullet was fired from the grassy knoll area nearby by hand not from the upper window of the book depository the likely origin of the first spine shattering explosion later testimony from witnesses told a tale of secret service agents in other cars who seemed asleep or operating in slow motion,1
B07BN1459L,he took a far more active role in saving both at home and overseas and in many different ways sometimes in secret as will be seen from the final section which are titled onstage and backstage i have learned that every man and every woman who has served the nation in a time of conflict including in recent years and now peacekeeping missions has a story to tell the earlier volume of world war one articles provided a remarkable insight into the lives of those who volunteered for king and country i hope this collection provides the same understanding of how australians fought against nazi germany and japanese imperialism john garfield oh singapore fo i think it is just patrol activity we're hearing brigadier to lieutenant colonel john right my unit in the fall of singapore by a jimmy james x wi one second echelon f during the night of sunday the eighth of february nineteen forty two one and a half divisions of jap troops with artillery crossed the johor strait and landed on the northwest side of singapore island beginning immediately and onslaught on our west force the next morning the hall of the allied air force evacuated singapore and became based on sumatra and the way was open for a jap on rash my unit was working on records at holland road about eight miles south of the jet landing but a rides and artillery fire became so frequent that we evacuated to balmoral house stephen road another eight miles through the south which we did on the tenth of february the next day at about eleven hundred as we were blitz from the air with anti personnel bombs the japs had no opposition in the air and could do what they liked with us our casualties were three killed and ten wounded at thirteen hundred and sixteen shares began to fall around us so we moved farther south again all this time the west force with the third indian call center force was putting up a mighty effort without a vile unfortunately the giant fifteen inch guns at chalky which could have been very helpful when not mounted so that they could be turned far enough to send their shells into the oncoming jets sensing a quick victory the jumps became berserk they went wild shooting up everything everywhere some had seeped through our lines and as they were dressed as peasants it was difficult to detect them they procured arms and ammunition from project natives in singapore city and established themselves in trees in the streets from which they kept the continuous sniping i saw myself three of these men tumble out of trees when fired on at this stage old troops were the front line or otherwise were not up to their necks the australian field ambulances had set up in st andrew's cathedral where they were trading the wounded as best they could under an incessant bombardment at the alexandra military hospital in singapore the critical die was the thirteenth of february during the morning routine work was continued in the afternoon and setting forty hours the japs have inside attacking towards the sisters quarters from where the sisters had been previously evacuated as a number of japs reached the rear door of the hospital lieutenant watson went from the reception room with a white flag to indicate the surrender of the hospital the japs took no notice at all of the white flag and made for lieutenant watson and they bayoneted savagely to death the japs then ran a mark on the ground floor one party entered the operating theatre block and at this time operations were being performed in the corridor between the sisters bank and the main theatre as the best lighted and my sheltered area in the hospital the japs climbed into the car door motion the staff to move along and then for apparently no reason at all set upon the unarmed staff with a binance lieutenant roberts was binded twice through the thorax and died immediately,1
B07KL64VDH,chapter two identifying what you want the importance of culture and determining what you want one of the most important things to talk about is how do you fit in why is that so important all employees have essential human wants and needs despite the generation they were born into these feelings motivations desires and a sense of purpose actually matter how people feel about coming to work contributing being able to to be their authentic self and feel like they fit in mean they feel welcomed and valued is absolutely essential to employee engagement and to achieving business results this all ties back into a company achieving it's organizational strategy organizations have to have the right employees with the right skills in the right place nice those employees want to know how and where they fit into the strategic direction employees need to know what their purposes and coming to work every day employees need to understand how their contribution is helping the organization win now both organizations and the people that work in them have needs we need to talk about them openly and not reserved for closed door office or conference room conversations there is power and having a shared sense of purpose it does incredible things for people and groups trying to work together organizational strategy creates an immediate need and requires the aligning and developing of people to meet it if you hope to achieve that approach and be successful leaders of organizations should not shy away away from talking about the wants needs and motivations of employees this type of conversation takes a level of transparency for some leaders it could be uncomfortable but without that level of transparency they can't build trust with you as an employee being welcomed and valued is important and unique to each individual that's why leaders and managers must get to know the people who work for them get to know who they are what they value what they bring to the table even when they may feel different new or unfamiliar even when the people they're talking to don't automatically think the same way or don't contribute in a way they're most comfortable with with fitting in knowing your purpose and feeling you are both meeting your needs and those of the organization is good but engagement and retention take more than that more than just fitting in you want to feel valued you want to feel welcomed not only when you come to work on a monday or after a vacation you want to feel that when you show up each day people are genuinely happy to see you not from just a collegial standpoint but that you're part of the organization you want to feel like you matter and that your contributions help drive the execution of strategy connecting with your leader doesn't have to be through an intensive check check-in or meetings set on the calendar drive by sessions with your leader just stopping by in the morning on the way to get coffee on your way in can be just as empowering another aspect of setting an environment to get the best business results is authenticity everyone wants to do their best and tap into their real potential but people want to feel valued for who they are you want to think that you're doing something good something meaningful through your work that the hours spent in the office matter you're contributing to something greater than yourself what enables us to happen is developing a sense of self awareness that taps into your feelings and heightens your sense of professional identity and gives you a greater feeling of self worth unfortunately many organizations don't think about that unless it is pointed out here are a few things to be on the watch for in a company or organization to determine if being authentic is embraced or avoided do you see leaders managers and employees engaging each other across functions across levels and across generations is there friction or do things for the most part work fluidly work is such a big part of our lives should we identify personally with our work and find satisfaction in what we do most everyone wants to be themselves it's not easy trying to be someone or something you're not it's stressful and you spend all of that time in the office trying to fit into a mold that quite frankly was never really made for you organization should understand that they need to appeal to the heart the head and not just the wallet of their employees leaders of organizations need to have a level of consideration for the employ they must create an environment where employees believe that is good for them to work there that they're being paid fairly and are valued and are helping the organization achieve business results,0

B002ZP8M44,i have been asked why i as a latina am writing a book on multicultural leadership rather than leadership that springs from my community although it is insightful to look at latino or black or american indian leadership separately this continues to imply that leadership in each of these communities is pertinent only to that one group and is not relevant and generic enough for widespread application latino leadership is seen to be of interest only to people who are involved or work with this population black leadership is not regarded as applicable to mainstream organizations although though there is significant literature on it's widespread effectiveness likewise american indian spirituality is not understood as the very essence of their leadership that can enrich all cultures multicultural leadership has broad relevance and application to the diverse world that we live in a culture truly integrated model has greater impact influence and scope delving into leadership models from specific communities will certainly enhance a person's ability to relate more effectively with that population but will not necessarily be applicable to the growing diversity that exists a multi cultural leadership approach on the other hand offers practices and tools that will be effective with many populations furthermore even though blacks latinos and american indians have distinct ways of leading there are key points of convergence as will be noted a number of core cultural dynamics are shared by communities of color their history as colonized people is a common denominator that in genders leadership forms that are people centered community focused and advocacy oriented all three cultures center on collect iv or group welfare and value generosity and reciprocity by identifying such points of convergence multi cultural leadership that integrates black latino and american indian strengths can be brought forth these unifying factors lay the foundation for eight principles formulated in his book articulating these commonalities will cultivate a greater sense of unity among communities of color by working together to find common ground and develop a collective force these communities can proactively influence a more culturally inclusive leadership form as the hope the elders have prophesied the time of the lone wolf is over the future of communities of color lies in their unity and collective force focusing on the cultural crossroads that shape multicultural leadership in no way denies the power or importance of leadership within the black ak latino or american indian communities recognizing common abilities and celebrating differences are two of the touchstones of diversity i hope this book will inspire people to deepen their understanding about the unique gifts that many cultures bring to leadership i feel uniquely qualified to discuss leadership in black latino and american indian communities i was the first president and ceo of the nationally spinal leadership institute and have directed latino organizations for over twenty years through the chevron management institute i do designed a leadership program that trained ninety urban league presidents spelman college's center for leadership and civic engagement honored me with their legacy award i was initiated into the colorado women's hall of fame and presented the wise woman award by the center for women's policy studies i also taught at the center for creative leadership in the leadership development program the most highly utilized corporate training program in the world the u s peace corps acknowledged me with a franklin miller award for my lifelong commitment to advancing communities of color most important i have listened to the voices of diverse leaders many of whom i have worked with closely this book reflects the composite of our experiences and ways of leading my own background is also multicultural central american indian spanish and french my grandmother was indigenous her long braids hung down her back as she never cut her hair coming from the caribbean coast of nicaragua i have black and latino relatives,0
B07D9QDT2S,only half as large from which to draw new recruits there was no doubt that an invasion of britain was already in hitler's sights and short of outright surrender there seemed little chance of avoiding it since the british expeditionary force is scrambled to safety from the beaches of dunkirk a fortnight earlier the british public had caught their first glimpse of what a german invasion might mean in the wake of the exhausted demoralised and bedraggled soldiers who stepped off the little ships came a stream of pitiful refugees tens of thousands of ordinary civilians whose homes had been overrun by the german army and whose lives had already been destroyed thanks to their apparently invincible war machine many of those who saw them couldn't help wondering if the wretched state of the new arrivals was a premonition of what was to come when the germans finally landed on their own soil on both sides preparations for the expected invasion were beginning to get underway the german army navy and air force had been discussing possible strategies since the previous december now following the fall of france the german high command began to draw up more definite plans under the code name operation sea lion i have decided to prepare for an invasion hitler wrote in his directive number sixteen intended to eliminate england as a base for carrying on the war against germany and should it be required completely to occupy it once the rf had been pummeled into submission by the lift buffer the plan was for over a quarter of a million men to be landed in a matter of days enough to seize the country for the furor and put an end to the war once and for all in britain ordinary people were readying themselves for the expected onslaught almost half a million men aged from seventeen to sixty five had already enrolled as local defence volunteers not yet rebranded as the home guard and were practicing making molotov cocktails to hurl at german tanks up and down the country temporary roadblocks had prepared using tree trunks abandoned cars and carts full of builders rubble and fields where enemy aircraft might land had been peppered with obstacles to the petroleum warfare department was looking into ways of repelling an enemy fleet by setting the sea itself on fire the day before the war cabinet meeting on the channel islands ch churchill had told the british people to prepare themselves to face the whole fury and might of the enemy and to brace themselves for a battle that would be remembered for a millennium as the nation's finest hour as the prime minister delivered his speech in parliament government printing presses were rattling off one point five million copies of a leaflet entitled if the invader comes to be distributed up and down the country over the next few days think always of your country before you think of yourself it declared firmly privately many civilians were starting to wonder how they would cope if the germans came knocking on their door some resolved to commit suicide ideally taking a few of the invaders down with them a wealthy lady in buckinghamshire planned to invite a group of officers in for champagne laced with weedkiller others felt they could do their bit by depriving them of valuables applies the government had advised homeowners to hide maps bicycles petrol even food at a dorset branch of the women's institute there was a spirited debate about how to prevent their large stock of homemade jam from falling into enemy hands some members felt that every jar should be smashed to smithereens others that merely hiding them under the floorboards was sufficient the government leaflet didn't mention the possibility of long term occupation but many who read it must have had that thought at the back of their minds they had seen the nations of europe collapse one by one under the weight of the german advance and the result in every case had been the same for all churchill's impassioned rhetoric there was no guarantee that the great fight to repel the invaders would succeed and assuming it failed what then what would a german occupation of britain look like of course they and we never had to find out three months later in september nineteen forty after the loot buffer unexpectedly fail to cripple the rf in the battle of britain hitler reluctantly shelved operation sea lion a german invasion and occupation was no longer on the cards but for more than seventy five years the specter of what might have been has haunted us there but for the grace of god went we our collective nightmares have been realized in a variety of chillingly realistic fictions beginning with the nineteen forty two propaganda movie went the day well in which a platoon of disguised german paratroopers take over a small english village the prospect of a britain under occupation has proved irresistibly fascinating in novels such as len dayton's ssg,1

B0040H3FPQ,the number of buildings in different parts of the city is at variance with the information from chassidus the tacit dispersion which is widely accepted by historians says that the great fire began at a single location the circus maximus but let us follow diodes line a little further he also wrote after graphically describing how the fire affected the city's million or more residents and caused widespread grief while the whole population was in this state of mind and many crazed by the disaster were leaping into the very flames nero went up to the roof for the palladium his hp palace on rome's palatine hill from which there was the best general view of the greater part of the conflagration and assuming the dress of a liar player he sang the capture of troy as he called the song himself though to the eyes of the spectators it was the capture of rome to begin with everything on the palatine hill including the pilate room was as dial himself would write destroyed in the fire along with every other building on the palatine hill the palace was consumed in the fires first stage even if we assume that dial meant that niro us attended the pollachi en route to play his liar during the early stages of the fire before the flames reach the palace no other roman writer put niro on the roof of his palace at rome playing the lyre at any time during the great fire casitas wrote that nero only set off back to rome when he heard that the fire was approaching his palace daya clearly took his lead from niro's biographers we tony is whose parents actually lived at rome at the time of the great fire suetonius himself was born some five years later sweet tony has made nero culpable for the conflagration writing pretending to be disgusted by the drab old buildings and narrow winding streets of rome he niro brazenly set fire to the city although a party of x consoles caught his attendance armed with to the course and broken part of flax and hemp and blazing torches trespassing on their property they dared now not interfere sweet tony has went on to say of nero he also coveted the sites of several granaries solidly built in stone near the golden house having knocked down their walls with siege engines he set the interiors ablaze the terror lasted for six days and seven nights causing many people to take shelter her and monuments and tombs niro's men destroyed not only a vast number of apartment blocks but mentions that i belonged to famous generals and was still decorated with their triumphal trophies temples too vowed and dedicated by rome's kings and others during the punic and gallic wars in fact very ancient monuments of historical interest that had survived up to that time nero watched the conflagration from the tower of messiness enraptured by what he called the beauty of the flames then put on his trojans costume and saying the sack of ilium from beginning to end here then was sweet tony as his account written several decades after the event in which nero was described as singing while rome burned but not from the roof of his palace cassius dio wrote his history of rome using the works of earlier writers adding his own opinions biased his and flourishes such as changing the name of the tune supposedly played by nero apparently to give more emphasis to the claim that niro's celebrated the destruction of his capital and of course sweet tony's account of the fire was one to which dial would have had access long after it was written even though testis makes no mention of it there is a high probability that when nero arrived back at rome from entomb he did indeed observe the fire from the vantage point of the tower of messiness which stood on the escalon hill in the imperial gardens of messiness the fire was eventually brought to a halt at the foot of the ethical line and perhaps nero did sing a song or two during that fraud week of the fire but did he celebrate the fire and did he in fact set it as sweet tony is alone among first or second century writers claimed and as dire much later echoed some of suetonius his facts and his book de vita caesarism or lives of the caesars in which she wrote the above passages about the great fire are demonstrably incorrect while others are mystifyingly jumbled and some obviously invented suetonius apparently,1

B0761XZ72C,sometimes children learn to play games by observing their mothers and fathers interacting with each other in other cases children intuitively learn what games to play with their mothers fathers and siblings when they find that the games get them strokes they are reinforced to continue the games games are based upon discounts as we will see it takes two discounts to play a game the discount is a put down of my own needs wants or feelings those of someone else a problem or the situation for example a game can be initiated by a perfectly reasonable request that is ill timed how many times has a husband asked a wife to make love when she is irritable tired or very busy the result is that he is rejected and feels persecuted little does he realize that he is initiated a game of kick me by discounting the existence of a problem discounts are communicated through actions as well as words a smile or an enticing maneuver can convey a discount just as easily as something that has said a game cannot be initiated without a discount on the part of the first player and no game develops if the second person refuses to discount in other words there is seldom a persecutor or rescuer without a cooperative victim each game has six steps a con a gimmick a response a switch a cross up and the payoff here's a typical game secretary i have to work late tonight mr smith this sounds like an adult stimulus on the social level at the same time however she makes some suggestive gesture with her walk her eyebrows her tone of voice or in some other way conveys a sexual message on the psychological level let's get sex see if miss jones is not aware that she has sent this message she is discounting some of her own sexual feelings if she is aware and has no intention of following up on the message she is discounting mr smith this overt and covert stimulus is called the con the ulterior component is a secret stimulus from child to child parent to child or child to parent in this case it is a child to child stimulus let's get sexy boss so do i this is his response to the overt stimulus the game will not proceed unless he also responds to the covert stimulus he probably will do so however because there is a gimmick involved an area of weakness or vulnerability on his part which she intuitively perceives in this case the gimmick is that the boss does not have sufficient sexual self control the con plus the gimmick elicit a response to the ulterior message the boss thinks boy would i ever like to take you to bed and make some overt sexual gesture this is the second discount without which the game would not take place mr smith is responding to a covert message without taking into account himself miss jones and the situation secretary indignantly why mr smith i am surprised at you just because i'm a secretary doesn't mean i'm a sexual object this part of the game is called the switch the secretary is now denying her earlier secret stimulus boss confused i'm sorry miss jones i serve certainly don't think of you as a sexual object and i apologize this is the cross up in which the respondent because of the switch is surprised or confused the boss leaves feeling guilty the secretary feels justifiably angry and has also reinforced her belief that men are all alike she has won her payoff have bad feelings in this case an excuse to be angry as in most games the payee also ends up with a negative feeling and probably with reinforcement of one or more of his script beliefs as well why would anybody want to play a game and end up with bad feelings there are seven reasons for playing games destruct your time to promote the script to get strokes to collect stamps to make other people predictable to avoid intimacy and to promote one's basic position in my clinical practice i have found the most people after they identify games that they play are able to find out why they have been playing them by checking this list of reasons usually a game will accomplish several of these aims at once for example people who play games around alcohol usually receive a tremendous number of negative strokes for drinking excessively the amount of time they a structure in drinking having a hangover having bad feelings and discussing their drinking with people is enormous they have decided in childhood that they are not okay and after every drink they end up feeling very not okay about themselves many alcoholics promote their scripts by drinking the outcome of an alt mahalik script is often death or at least an unhappy life,0
B002V1NWX8,we have the world war did not work chocolates a bag of coffee beans or some tinned meat would have caused nobody but a fool would trust the neapolitans when their bellies were full but they had not been for for some time they were spectacularly empty so it had been all right but in july nineteen forty three things had begun to go wrong the weather was still fine the girls still pretty and hitler and mussolini were still friends unfortunately though mussolini had been kicked out of office by his own henchmen and arrested by his own king the new government if it really was new nobody seemed to be sure cad sued for an armistice and got it at first the germans had received orders to withdraw the roman it had been very humiliating the neapolitans had watched from their windows with those dark eyes that told you nothing some of the girls blessed them had been in the streets and thrown flowers but it had all been very glum then in a matter of days new orders had come down from rome turned back and held the city that was more like a soldier of the reich's job not running away like a lot of italians and there would be fighting to do the enemy had landed some thirty miles down the coast behind some mountains when the wind was right you could hear the thunder of the guns and the ge germans were ready and waiting for them the officer in charge of the detachment in the truck checked his map all to cali there were no street names the neapolitans were careless about such things as plaques but there and there were the six roads leading to the piazza where he had parked the truck according to orders god in heaven what a slum it was but then it sometimes seemed that naples was all slum up on the hill where they had their headquarters it was elegant enough palaces gardens what you would expect of italy but the rest made one wonder how people could live in such hovels yet they did and they had for centuries he twisted the map about on his knees that must be the road that led to the airport of cappuccino borders were plain and precise they were to cut all telephone wires he leaned out of the cabin and saw a soldier busy up a pole so that was being done they will also have to stop and disarm any italian soldier or amen coming from the airport if he obeyed it was to be treated as a friend and an ally if he did not halt he was to be shot on sight they officer in command looked back to the window and saw that the machine gunner was duly at his post he waited he surveyed the piazza of the narrow streets and the houses there was nobody to be seen he frowned of a corporal next to him said anything worrying you sir yes it's quiet it is that sir naples is never quiet come to think of it no site isn't the officer in command watched the silent piazza with growing suspicion here comes someone said the corporal there was the sound of a high treble voice singing a neapolitan song then the singer came in view it's only a boy sir the small boy grinned cheerfully and wave to the soldiers pretty song said the corporal and waved back can do pretty little thief said the officer in command though street boys are cunning little scoundrels every one of them has started a fight once in front of this truck draw knives on each other tie was full enough to get down and tried to stop it ugly sight two small boys going for each other with nasty looking blades that stopped or right after a bit of argument then i found that a gang of their friends had cleaned out the whole damned truck behind while i was being a good christian out in front put up job sir said the corporal sagely yes i've heard about their tricks what's the singing about sir you know a little of their lingo don't you and just pillow italian said the lieutenant and both young men laughed hellenic as it doesn't help the little devil singing in neapolitan and not a word of it can i ever understand for the little devil sang very rapidly and loudly in his incomprehensible dialect wiped his nose on the tattered sleeve of his shirt and disappeared the soldier who had been cutting the telephone wires finished his task and climbed back into the truck all amid the same unnatural silence then it was broken by the sound of automobile engines the corporal jumped onto the road and reported at two trucks coming from the airport italian air force stop them said the lieutenant climbing down to stand beside the corporal and if they don't stop use this it's messy but more sure than shooting he gave him a hand grenade the two vans were coming at a fair pace down the road as the first vehicle entered the piazza the driver saw the german,1

B00DHOS3PA,become the first europeans to discover to explore and colonize the north american coast down to newfoundland and of course millennia before erickson about twenty thousand years ago numerous people had walked from siberia to alaska across the land bridge that had previously existed across what is now the bering sea and had migrate itself now these two myths about columbus are well known but a great deal of what we think we know about american history and subsequently believe is equally mythical and wrong this course is a skeptic's guide to american history and a key aspect of the call source will be identifying these myths what is a skeptic a skeptic is an individual who frequently asks questions about widely accepted ideas and facts almost by definition the serious student of history must be a skeptic for as historians know and often emphasize in their classes many popular beliefs about history in general and about u s history in particular are myths either totally false or at best only half true i often quip that my two introductory courses in us history should really be entitled iconoclasm one and iconoclasm two in this course we will examine these myths of us history but not only the myths we will also examine how and why they arose and what historians now say about what really happened as opposed to what most americans believe happened in the case of the columbus smith's two causes were probably washington and irving who in a bestselling work first published in eighteen twenty eight disseminated this mythology about proving the earth was round and the ignorance at that time as well as lack of physical evidence about both ericsson and the land bridge to asia in the process of examining these myths their origins and the historical realities we will also explore the complexities of history and just what historians do and in that exploration the course will once again challenge popular misconceptions this time about the study of history itself self specifically history does not consist of rote memorization of facts about the past and those facts do not speak for themselves i often tell my introductory courses that i have never seen a talking fact and i asked my students have you facts don't speak human beings do and human beings both select and organize facts about the past so as to make sense out of it in addition history does not repeat itself and the incorrect belief that it does often leads to faulty analogies between past and present with tragic often disastrous consequences two examples of this are the french construction of the maginot line during the nineteen thirties in the incorrect belief that any new war would be a repeat of the first world war and as we will see in a future lecture cold war thinking that joseph stalin was a reincarnation of adolf hitler now along with this incorrect belief that history repeats itself often goes the equally incorrect belief that one can draw clear lessons from these supposed repetitions but as the political scientist bernard brodie accurately noted more than forty five years ago the phrase history teachers when encountered an all argument usually portends bad history and worse logic another fallacy is the belief that history and memory are synonymous or nearly so in truth they are separate and they are often antithetical to each other beyond challenging such misconceptions this course will explore some of the important realities of historical study for example what historians often call the law of unintended consequences the fact that the consequences of human actions often differ sharply quite sharply from the mo innovations of those who acted columbus for example wanted to find a western water route to the indies not discover america and he incorrectly thought he had found that route which is why he called the native inhabitants he met indians in addition we select facts to study in history on the bay basis of those often unintended consequences even though columbus was not the first european to discover the americas his explorations in this regard are far more important historically than those of leif erikson because of their enormous consequences nothing permanent and important,1
B086LK8FDQ,in the second century of the christian era the empire of rome comprehended the fairest part of the earth and the most civilized portion of mankind the frontiers of that extensive monarchy were guarded by ancient renown and disciplined valour the gentle but powerful influence of laws and manners had gradually cemented the union of the provinces their peaceful inhabitants enjoyed and abused the advantages of wealth and luxury the image of a free constitution was preserved with decent reverence the roman senate appeared to possess the sovereign authority and devolved on the emperors all the executive powers of government during a half a period of more than four score years the public administration was conducted by the virtue and abilities of never trajan hadrian and the two and two nines it is the design of this and of the two succeeding chapters to describe the prosperous condition of that empire and afterwards from the death of marcus antoninus to deduce the most important circumstances of it's decline and fall a revolution which will ever be remembered and is still felt by the nations of the earth the principal conquests of the romans were achieved under the republic and the emperors for the most part was satisfied with preserving those dominions which had been a key wired by the policy of the senate the active emulations of the consoles and the martial enthusiasm of the people the seven first centuries were filled with a rapid succession of triumphs but it was reserved for augustus to relinquish the ambitious design of subduing the whole earth and to introduce a spirit of moderation into the public councils inclined to peace by his temper and situation it was easy for him to discover that rome in her present exalted situation had much less to hope than to fear from the chance of arms and that in the prosecution of remote was the undertaking became every day more difficult the event more doubtful and the possession more precarious and less beneficial the experience of augustus added weight to the salutary reflections and effectually convinced him that by the prudent vigor of his counsels it would be easy to secure every concession which the safety or the dignity of rome might require from the most formidable barbarians instead of exposing his person and his legions to the arrows of the parthians he obtained by an honorable treaty the restitution of the standards and prisoners which had been taken in the defeat of crassus his generals in the early part of his reign attempted the reduction of ethiopia and arabia felix they marched near we're a thousand miles to the south of the tropic but the heat of the climate soon repelled the invaders and protected the un warlike natives of those sequestered regions the northern countries of europe scarcely deserved the expense and labor of conquest the forests and morasses of germany were filled with a haughty race of barbarians who despised life when it was separated from freedom and though on the fast attack they seemed to yield to the weight of the roman power they soon by a signal act of despair regained their independence and reminded augustus of the vicissitudes of fortune on the death of that emperor is testament was publicly read in the senate he bequeathed as a valuable legacy to his successes the advice of confining the empire within those limits which nature seemed to have placed as it's permanents bulwarks and boundaries on the west the atlantic ocean the rhine and danube on the north the euphrates on the east and towards the south the sunday dec efforts of arabia and africa happily for the repose of mankind the moderate system recommended by the wisdom of augustus was adopted by the fears and vices of his immediate successors engaged in the pursuit of pleasure or in the exercise of tyranny the first caesars seldom showed themselves to the army's ot the provinces nor were they disposed to suffer that those triumphs which their indolence neglected should be usurped by the conduct and valour of their lieutenants the military fame of a subject was considered as an insolent invasion of the imperial prerogative and it became the duty as well as interest of every roman general to god the frontiers entrusted to his care without aspiring to conquests which might have proved no less fatal to himself than to the vanquished barbarians the only accession which the roman empire received during the first century of the christian era was the province of britain in this single instance the successes of caesar and augustus were persuaded to follow the example of the former rather than the precept of the latter the proximity of it's situation to the coast of gaul seemed to invite their arms the pleasing though doubtful intelligence of a pearl fishery attracted their avarice and as britain was,1

B00DIGLIHC,the different answers to this question but i think the overwhelming reason is that rome has exerted a continuous and profound influence on the history of much of europe but of the western world because of the dominance of the western world in the global forum of the whole world the the heritage of ancient rome is vast and i will give you just one example from the complicated mosaic of how this heritage has been transferred to us this is the grand tour the so-called grand tour that was very popular in the renaissance right through to the nineteenth century but especially popular among british noblemen noble use especially men in the eighteenth century the grand tour was a prerequisite for the educated man who had of course already read his latin and greek in school and perhaps in universities and around tour involve traveling over to the continent from england usually beginning at paris and then with no set itinerary moving through the great cultural centres of europe but the destination was invariably all of us rome that you could add in florence and naples because in the eighteenth century at this time pompeii was just been discovered and excavated in a very systematic way so naples was also a popular destination but for roman regions and of course venice was also a popular spot but the ultimate destination was invariably rome at any one time there could be hundreds of englishman traversing the continent on their way looking at all the ancient monuments in seventeen eighty six for instance sir john fleming leicester noted that rome was quote perfectly filled with english unquote and edward gibbon was prompted to write his vast and magisterial study the decline and fall of the roman empire whilst sitting on the capitoline hill in rome on the grand tour as a young man in seventeen sixty four well the direct way that the ancient world came into the modern through these grand tours is self evident when these people came back from italy and from rome they brought with them the sensibilities of the ancient world they liked to decorate their houses are build them even in neoclassical styles that they like to surround themselves either with genuine ancient the artifacts are with fakes and of course in the poetry they wrote the literature they wrote they reproduced ancient roman sensibilities again and again direct cultural influence through the grand tour but that's only one tiny tessera of the larger mosaic in fact if we look around us in the modern world the face of rome is every where to be seen as long as you know where to look and how to identify when you look there for instance the romans have given us two major models of government a republic a balanced republic involving usually a limited enfranchised body of citizens who elect members of a council that also has an executive branch of officers answerable to that council who carry out the orders of the council that is a roman model of government the other model which is not of course popular on this side of the atlantic but has been very popular in europe and is still around in certain places is a monarchy but a monarchy tempered by law and tradition and also a monarchy answerable to councils and the public and other form of government that has died out since but has bought was very popular and very common in europe for many centuries was absolute monarchy all of these are roman models in the case of the united states of america for instance the founders were unequivocally and directly influenced by their knowledge of the ancient roman past in formulating the constitution in fact recent books of the subject have emerged that bring this out absolutely clearly one published in nineteen ninety five is called the founders and the classics and show is not just how the polity of the usa has been influenced by ancient rome but how attitudes towards pastoralism agriculture the place of the citizen in the state and so forth were all informed by the founders knowledge of the classics and particularly of the roman classics another feature of the roman world that we inherit and take for granted is our reverence for the law the romans loved the law they conceived of the law somewhat differently from the way we do it wasn't a law of individual human rights the way our modern law is but the notion that the law stands above us all that the law is something to which all of us are are answerable including the members of the of the government that is a roman concept the romans also em were very profligate by ancient standards with their citizenship which is another feature certainly of of america if we think about it how many different people can come and become citizens of america,1

B07BHXDXW9,i many centuries and time and transport ourselves from the heart of the continent of europe to it's very periphery the island of ireland this time we will start with a scene of celtic defeat it is april sixteen one three hugh o'neill is the leader of the most dangerous rebellion again zte english rule in ireland since the arrival of the first english colonists in the twelfth century but after losing a key battle in the south of ireland he has been hiding out on his northern estates he knows queen elizabeth the first is close to death but he would prefer to wait and make peace with her successor the future for james the first who he thinks will give him a better deal finally o'neill cannot hold out any longer and he submits only afterwards does he discover that he has been tricked by the english lord deputy mount joy who has concealed news of the queen's death until after o'neill has made his submission the english government slowly undermines his traditional rights as an irish chieftain until four years later he feels driven to go into exile alongside several other irish lords this so called flight of the earls marked the effective end of native rule in ireland and the beginning of a long period of repression and marginalisation for the native irish during which time the irish language declines along with many other aspects of traditional irish culture now the scene of triumph it is may twenty eleven a different queen elizabeth is on a state visit to the republic of ireland she visits the graves of irish patriots who had rebelled against british rule and leaves a floral tribute she makes a speech in which she alludes to the trouble the past relationship between britain and ireland with regret and to the astonishment and delight of her audience she begins her speech with a couple of words in the irish language so we have two encounters between celtic peoples and they're much more power powerful adversaries the first began in triumph and ended in defeat while the second began in defeat and ended in reconciliation though of course the story continues these encounters will form a large part of this course on the celtic world we will learn about the fan fascinating story of the ancient celts who roamed across europe and terrified the romans and the greeks but who also created one of the most captivating art styles the world has ever seen we will also tell the story of the celtic fringe a region on the extreme edge of western europe were the people created and preserved traditions in art music and literature that influenced modern culture around the world these celtic areas have been defined in various ways over time but to give them their most expansive definition they include the whole of the island of ireland and the western parts of britain especially scotland wales and cornwall in the southwest and also including the isle of man in the irish sea between ireland and britain but the celtic realms also include brittany in western france and by some definitions they include the northwestern parts of spain especially alicia so we've got two stories to tell the story that takes place in the heart of europe and the story that takes place on the periphery of europe and we're going to explore the connection between these two phenomena the fierce warriors of the continent who gave the romans a run for their money and the residents of ireland and the other key celtic realms who kept ancient traditions alive in the face of relentless pressure from centralizing monarchies especially england and france how are these two stories related the answer used to be simple but it has become more complicated as we will see in a moment this course will also tell the story of how those traditions were spread around the world by emigrants from the celtic realms some of these phenomena are readily recognisable as celtic in origin the shamrock that celtic cross the mischievous leprechaun and his pot of gold at the end of the rainbow the banshee who wails mysteriously to signal a death the highland bagpipe and the tartan among many others as we will see in later lectures some of these supposedly celtic traditions have been transformed in ways that their originators would not recognize still most people can easily identify them as irish or scottish we will tell the story,1

B087X9J8MR,introduction the history of the united states is to a large extent a history of armed conflict the nation was first born in war a tough fight for independence against one of the world's largest empires and that fight would resume less than a generation later with the war of eighteen twelve then there are constant low level conflicts with native americans as the nation expanded westward and occasionally the country engaged in full-scale war against the sioux comanche and apache the country also brought the mexican american war starting in eighteen forty six and the bloody civil war starting and eighteen sixty one these conflicts help the united states establish it's modern boundaries and what kind of nation it would be in the twentieth century the united states came into it's own as a global power through even more armed conflicts including world war one world war two the korean war the vietnam war and campaigns against several middle eastern nations while not all of these wars were won they did a stamp which the nation as a super power a status america retains today however there have been many other conflicts some small some considerable that helped shape the country and it's foreign policy even as they have been overlooked while every student knows of the vietnam war few are familiar with the sumatran expeditions and while americans involvement in the middle east is constantly in today's headlines the battles against the barbary pirates are widely forgotten in fact there were conflicts in the seventies eighties and seventeen nineties that tested the territorial integrity of the country at home shay's rebellion consisted of men who had just years earlier participated in the american revolution and were not afraid to break down a government they did not like indeed men any of them reveled in it the revolutionary war one america her independence but the nation still had states and local populations with varying interests when massachusetts enacted laws that daniel says and others didn't like the rebels had no qualms about taking up arms and while the rebellion was avenge actually put down changes were made to prevent similar problems in the future a few years later in the wake of secretary of the treasury alexander hamilton implementing a tax on whiskey violence broke out in seventeen ninety poor among opponents of the tax who numbered in the thousands president washington himself felt compelled to raise a militia force and personally lead it to deal with rebels the only time an american president has led soldiers in the field ultimately no pitched battle took place once the militia was marched into western pennsylvania but dozens were arrested and tried for treason in the wake of the episode while the breaking up of the revolt was praised by most american ns some continued to oppose the tax until jefferson's administration repealed it upon coming to power in eighteen o one,1
B00RC650HI,he searched hard enough she'd likely find a handful of others who'd hung out with ted since kindergarten hello she managed a smile although her heart was pounding was aaron at this very instant threading his way through the people standing between them there wasn't any reason he should feel uncomfortable approaching her maybe they hadn't kept in touch while she was gone but there'd been no expectations along those lines their former relationship hadn't involved any commitment or obligation they'd partied a great deal and they'd had the hottest sex she'd ever experienced but as far as he was concerned it was all in fun they hadn't even had a fight when she left the death of her mother and the knowledge of her pregnancy had set her off on a self destructive odyssey that led her to an abortion clinic in arizona she felt sure that ending her pregnancy he was what aaron would want if he knew about it which was why when she decided to keep the baby she didn't feel she owed him anything even notice that why it was his shea told me you were moving back kyle said how long have you been in town she checked behind her but at all only five feet two inches tall she couldn't see over the people surrounding her and it was so packed she couldn't see through them either just a couple of weeks she paused to be polite but she wasn't about to hang out and talk for more than a quick second not with aaron ten feet away and possibly closing the distance between them unfortunately she couldn't leave ted had already signed and personalized her book and there was a huge line at the register reilly spoke before she could actually say the goodbye that hovered on her lips it's great to have you home you look amazing by the way he gave her a low whistle must be all that yoga pressly felt too anxious to enjoy the compliment or to tell them that yoga had done a lot more for her than help her get into the shape that would prove to be too long a discussion have you ever been to a class she asked instead kyle and riley exchanged a look can't say i have riley drawled with a smile that told her he probably wouldn't either once i get the studio open you'll have to give it a try she said if you'll be there i'll do it kyle volunteered presley hadn't expected either of them to flirt with her when she lived here before she'd always had the feeling that they considered themselves too good for her they'd been popular and well adjusted from the beginning she'd been a lost and lonely outcast who'd made some very poor choices she might have been flattered at how her reception had changed but she was too worried that she was about to be confronted by aaron she didn't want to speak to him it made no difference how many times she told herself that he wasn't the right man for her that their relationship had been unbalanced and unhealthy she couldn't stop longing for his smile his laugh his touch not that the difficulty of getting over him should have come as any surprise her whole life had been a series of struggles great i should be open for business in another week she had to open soon she couldn't go without income for much longer see there she could feel their eyes on her as she moved away could too well they were startled she'd brushed them off but with erin in the room all she wanted to do was melt into the background just the sight of his perfectly sculpted face which was almost too pretty despite the scar he'd gotten in a fight was enough to drag her to a place of weakness and craving he was like crack cocaine that had taken control of her life before she had to avoid him as avidly as all the other things that had nearly destroyed her it wasn't until she stepped through the curtain and into the dog store room where angelica hanson owner of turn the page received her inventory that presley relaxed she'd reach safety a hidden corner where he'd be unlikely to look for her once erin left she'd pay for her book and get out of there there but when she turned intending to peek out at those in the front of the store she collided with his hard unyielding chest as he came through the curtain he grabbed her before she could fall over the stack of books at her feet drawing her up against him what are you doing back here breaking his hole,0

B00X6BWYL8,the infamous first meeting between the betrothed cousins george prince of wales and princess caroline of brunswick took place in st james's palace on fifth of april seventeen ninety five she had just arrived by carriage from greenwich having been met off the royal yacht or gusta by her new lady in waiting lady jersey who also happened to be the prince's mistress he had come directly from his extravagant powell mal mansion carlton house as the handsome but flabby prince entered the room his bride to be fair haired and pretty yet short and with a head too large for her body utter tempted to kneel he raised her gracefully enough recorded lord malmesbury the only witness and embraced her said barely one word turned round and returned to a distant part of the apartment calling mom's brea to him he said harris i am not well pray get me a glass of brandy sir replied in embarrassed malmesbury had you not better have a glass of water no said the prince with an oath i will go directly to the queen and away he went without uttering another word the princess was astonished my god she said in french her english would never be perfect does the prince always act like this i think he's very fat and he's nothing like as handsome as his portrait moms pre replied that the prince was naturally a good deal affected and flurried at this first interview but she would certainly find him different at dinner and so she did but it was too late the princess and gallant reception of his young fiance at twenty six she was six years his junior was largely due to her exceptionally low standards of personal hygiene malmesbury had noticed these deficiencies during the long journey from brunswick and had felt necessary to advise her that the prince was very delicate and expected a long and very careful twilight the property which meant at the very least washing herself well all over but this sound advice had made only a temporary impression and she had since ritter turn to her old ways wearing course petticoats and shifts thread stockings and these never well washed or changed often enough when the fastidious prince met her for the first time her pungent body odor was unmistakable it did not help that her good looks were offset by a short stocky physique whereas the prince preferred tall stout women or that he was already married albeit secretly and had only agreed to a second affair actual ceremony as a means of reducing his ruinous debts the final straw came during the farcical wedding night when the prince discovered that his new wife was not a virgin there is no appearance of blood he later told mom's brie and her manners were not those of another this he managed to make love to her just three times twice that night and once the next before his repulsion got the better of his sense of duty a daughter charlotte was conceived in the process but she died twenty one years later in childbirth leaving him without an heir seven years after his death the daughter of his younger brother the duke of kent succeeded to the throne as queen victoria two more contrasting monarchs would be hard to imagine,1

B0036IUSZK,hundred b c e before the common era or b c as it's often termed as well that's when the trojan war took place or whatever was changed into the trojan war by later writers that's when the exodus took place that are about them and we're going to keep going for then all the way up to about six hundred c e common era or a d which is the end of antiquity antiquity was slow and dying the roman empire was in one of the slowest falls on record it's like some ludicrous slow down in the movies where he was watch somebody hitting a ball and the ball flattened and snap away there's no way that you can pick the exact moment but by six twenty or so with the rise of islam the process was pretty much completed and we're going to roll through it and watch all the interactions as they unfold between hebrews greeks and roy moments you can sink in a way of the formation of western civilization in antiquity on the analogy of a giant river system like the congo the amazon or closer to home for many of us perhaps the mississippi the mississippi is the mainstream although as it progresses from minnesota it gets the majority of it's water as that happens from the ohio and from the missouri if you think of rome as the mississippi and the greeks as the ohio and the longest and oldest of them all in that sense the missouri as the hebrews that's not too bad of an analogy and by the time we get to cairo illinois they're all mixing together and as we proceed in the course we will we'll talk about how all of these cultural elements from all of these different places and peoples mixed together to form the greco roman culture of late antiquity which is the immediate parent of western culture as we know it in the process will be taking a look at a whole lot familiar story some from the bible adam and eve the gospel accounts some from greece from homer and from the histories some from drama some from rome but i'm taking a look at those stories our primary focus won't be on their narrative interest and their charm great though that is in many cases instead it'll be on what they contribute towards the genesis of western values and the development of the distinctive cast of mind the intellectual toolkit which has been characteristic of western civilization from the very outset each of the lectures that follow as is this one is meant to be self contained to the extent that it is comprehensible and understandable in it's own right but i will also be making a systematic effort all the way through to show the connection between all of the lectures and between all of the topics that we discuss they'll be fourteen lectures total here's the introduction right now of course we're going to talk about the hebrews in the hebrew bible into after that will devote six to the greeks big contributions from the greek systematic rationality among other things we will devote to close range to the romans to to the christian bible and then we'll try and lecture number fourteen to wrap it all up and see what we're left with before we move on though we've got to address an important and fundamental question and it's a question that's been asked in society at large a lot you've no doubt heard it being asked why study western culture when there are so many other fabulous cultures out there that we could be studying we could be studying the miles we could be studying the inca we could be studying the hausa we could be studying china we can be studying japan there's a whole slew of cultures out there and they're all valuable and they all represent successful means of interacting with the world why the west well first of all sometimes you gotta look in the mirror jazz to see what's there and in some profound sense western culture influence as it has been to it's great benefit by surrounding cultures and cultures with which it interacts all kinds of cultures western culture nevertheless is no one in which we have been raised in which we find ourselves it's where we come from and even in the process,1
B002V5CWNU,when the last roman emperor in italy is deposed and the empire doesn't exist any longer in the west but in fact he continues it because the empire the state that he is following the roman state does continue to exist in the east in what historians today refer to as the byzantine empire and it would continue to exist in the east for another thousand years this therefore led gibbon to continue his history for volume after volume until finally ending it in the year fourteen fifty three now in this course we're not going to go that far instead we will focus more on the west and on the fall of roman power in the west however your if your are interested in the subsequent history of the empire during that final thousand years there is also a course of on the byzantine empire as well what historians refer to as the byzantine empire ever since will really ever since it happened people have been fascinated by the question of the fall of rome how is it that a empire with that much power that much wealth and that much stability because it lasted for many centuries how is it possible that it finally broke apart and then finally ceased to exist during it's heyday it was widely believed that rome truly was the eternal city that it was the city that that would always be the ruler of the world and banned for centuries there was no good reason not to hold to those views because it was completely safe and protected in fact between the year three ninety b c and the er for ten a d almost exactly eight hundred years rome never was it's walls were never breached it was a a safe prosperous and very large city in the center of a vast empire how is it that it came apart and it all collapsed one of the reasons why this has remained so fascinating to people is that they have tended to particularly in the modern era since the eighteenth century people have tended to see in the decline and the fall of the roman empire lessons for their own societies and you can see this very clearly if you just simply look at some of the reasons that are given for the decline and fall of the empire over the over the past two centuries frequently the reasons that historians or other writers give for this fall are reasons or elements in those writers' own societies that they are worried about that they see their own society declining as a result of those factors will talk about a few of those in a moment and that in itself has been a real draw for people to look at why rome fell and in fact it's it's still true today it's very common today to to hear or to read about the decline and fall of the american empire or that american power is is falling or is in trouble or that america is in fact suffering from the same ills that affected the roman empire as well well first before we talk about some of those suggested reasons let's figure out what exactly we mean by fall and then la let's define what actually fell rome as a state or as a an entity began many centuries before it's fall it began in the eighth century probably some time in the eighth century bc when the city of rome was founded as rome grew in power and grew ooh and affluence first in italy and then elsewhere it developed a government a state that that set it apart from other states of the ancient world the romans created what they called a res publica or a republic which simply meant the public business but which we have since used to mean a kind of a state modeled at least loosely on the roman state the roman government as it was set up was one in which the rule of law was was crucial the romans were very fond and very proud of the fact that they were a nation of laws ruled by laws and not by men and what that meant was there were no kings there were no tyrants the way the ancient greeks would have there were there was no one who was supposed to have power or enormous amounts of power because that person could then become a king or a tyrant romans hated the concept of kingship when they had set their republic up at the very beginning traditionally the data's five o nine b c they did so in opposite mission to kings they overthrew kings and they set up a new system of government without kings throughout roman history and indeed throughout much of the period that will still be discussing in this course romans themselves continued this antipathy for the idea of royalty the idea that any one should have that much power instead the repub click the roman republic was was devised over time to be a system in which no one would be able to acquire that level of power and this was done through various mechanisms i want to mention in this context just a few because these are going to be concepts that were that we will need when we see the system break down during it's decline and fall there were in the roman system essentially three different we might call them branches of government they were they were not really understood in that respect but three different branches let's say for the sake of clarity said use that word the first of these and the most important was the people of rome all power in the roman system resided with the people of rome by people the romans mean all free citizens of the roman empire the people did not come together and make their voice known as the greeks would do in a democracy whereby all free citizens can come to the assemblies and have their voices heard and vote on on laws and make decisions together instead the people would would have representatives come to assemblies in rome and then those representatives would then vote on issues and they'd vote on bills too that would become laws they would vote vote on all sorts of various initiatives but that's where in the roman system the power resided in that assembly and the romans had different names for them over time and we don't really need to to worry about that here of what's important here is just to recognize that the assemblies was where all the power resided all of the power the assemblies were presided over by magistrates and and in this case a kind of a pseudo magistrate known as a tribune tribunes were elected officials that were elected by the common people what were known as the the plebs of the plebeians and the job of the tribune was to protect the interests of the common people and also tribune's presided over the assemblies they introduced legislation to the assemblies and the tribunes had the have the power to veto of latin word which means i forbid to veto the actions of other tribunes or or legislation that might be coming through or being put before the assemblies tribune's also had a certain aspect to them and that was what the romans called sacrosanctity this meant that while some one was serving as a tribune they could not be harmed for any reason whatsoever they could not be no hands could be laid on them and the reason for this was that that was supposed to preserve them so that they could defend the interests of the people that they could go anywhere and do anything they needed to to preserve those interests so they couldn't be arrested no kind of violence could be used against them or any kind of punishment can be used against them as long as they held that,1
B004Y1IJE0,the nation is dissolved the election of abraham lincoln to the presidency of the united states was considered by many southerners as the final affront and a long series of provocations that had pushed their states to the brink of secession ironically it was the southern political leaders themselves who had split the democratic ticket and eighteen sixty thus ensuring lincoln's election as a republican but the new president was anathema to the south he appeared to the south not as we now know him but as a malignant baboon with abolitionist serpents as attendants his election inspired the same fear and loathing that would arise today among conservatives if a communist were elected president samuel eliot morison and henry steel commodore the growth of the american republic southerners for years had been reacting with increasing violence to all pressures relating to slavery john brown's raid on harper's ferry in eighteen fifty nine in his subsequent election to martyrdom by the northern abolitionists were they felt a widespread conspiracy to murder southern women and children brown attacked the federal arsenal at harpers ferry to secure arms to begin an insurrection of the slaves unsuccessful he was tried for treason and hanged when northerners attacked slavery southerners defended the institution by pointing to the miserable conditions of northern factory workers southerners were incensed when northerners did not cooperate in the return of runaway slaves the law of the land clearly guarantee the return of such legal property and howls of frustration were heard when the south was prevented from ensuring that a new state in the union might introduce or encourage slavery all these stemmed from the two great exacerbating issues that divided the nation the primacy of states' rights over national interests and the right not only to maintain slavery but to extend it to new states and territories both issues had been debated since the formation of the federal government and the debated intensify wide as the first half of the nineteenth century drew to a close the case for secession according to morrison and commenter was based on the axiom that the federal constitution created a confederacy not a government and did not impair state sovereignty in eighteen hundred the vast majority of american citizens felt more loyal to their respective states than to the union in eighteen thirty none but virginians georgians in the south carolinians would have followed their states out of the union on any possible issue after eighteen forty four with the growth of southern self consciousness the phrase and the idea of state rights gave place in that section to southern right rights in december eighteen sixty a month after lincoln selection south carolina took the bull by the horns and seceded proclaiming that the union of south carolina with the other states under the name of the united states of america was dissolved by february texas florida mississippi jaw judge alabama and louisiana had followed south carolina out of the union these states dealt forthrightly with the issue of slavery that people in the north were interfering with the south's practice of that peculiar institution south carolina's proclamation said in part they the north have denounced as sinful the institution of slavery they have permitted the open establishment among them have abolition societies and have united and the election of a man to the high office of president of the u s whose opinions and purposes are hostile to slavery why was the issue of slavery so inflamed for southerners an important reason was the south's dependency on a single crop economy the invention of the cotton gin and the consequent demand for cotton in the world market had turned southern planters away from such staples as tobacco and rice by plan in cotton they were guaranteed a good profit but this profit depended on cheap labor so long as the slaves worked the field and a steady demand for cotton continued in the world market part of this demand came from the mills in the north slavery and cotton were a highly successful combination by mid century more than three quarters of the slave workforce some two and a half million slaves picked cotton the north had given up slavery long before largely because it was an economical the invention of the reaper had provided farmers in the north and midwest with a means to expand their production,1
B0748YDYM3,in eighteen ninety one and eighteen ninety two northern wyoming witnessed a series of shocking and murderous events which have come down to us as the johnson county war these happening staggered the people of wyoming and were made all the more bewildering by sensationally inaccurate newspaper articles that drowned out the reports of johnson county citizens the people directly involved in the events many volumes have been written about the johnson county war but the story has never been told from the viewpoint of the people in the community where the war occurred this is that story buffalo has been the seat of johnson county wyoming since eighteen eighty one when the county first began operation and the town was growing up as an adjunct to a frontier army post buffalo's peaceful and pleasing setting today makes it hard to believe this little town was once the center of a happening that as t a larsen wrote ranks as the most notorious event in the history of wyoming it was called the johnson county war it happened more than a century ago and within wyoming the very mention of johnson county still calls up a time of infamy even among the ambitious and active young people in johnson county rank canton stood out he was a proud tough and ferociously efficient peace officer traits that very early earned him the admiration and praise of the large cattle interests in the area he was thirty three in eighteen eighty two almost six feet tall and slender he was a good looking man who seemed to have many friends but johnson county people had conflicting feelings about him his personality was so strong that it seemed that his mere presence caused people anxiety he intimidated men with only a look fort mckinney may have been the primary economic force in johnson county but cattle raising was a close second one that supported a great number of cowboys and a few rich men observing that buffalo sat on the dividing line between the vast stock racing territory on the south and the agricultural country to the north the buffalo eco contended that the country to the south was not suitable for agriculture pursuits but was ideal for grazing the newspaper did not explain why only the northern part of the county was suitable for agricultural pursuits but it was certainly true that big companies running cattle dominated the southern half of the county while smaller family outfits raising crops and small herds of cattle dominated the northern half both of these groups spotted opportunity early and came into the country soon after the land became accessible large corporations exceptionally well funded pushed cattle into southern johnson county almost at the same time as fort mckinney was erected on clear creek eighteen seventy eight in eighteen seventy nine and began running mass massive herds they did so not on privately owned land but on the public domain land owned by the united states theoretically by each and every citizen in eighteen seventy eight and eighteen seventy nine that was every last acre in johnson county but the big cattle outfits in southern johnson county whether or not they held legal title occupied and monopolized huge chunks of land vastly more than they could ever legally claim asserting rights under fictitious legal theory such as range rights and accustomed ranges,1

B00CTOX76O,okay i'm an hour in and i'm already confused i'm going to have to forget any attempt at defining british achievements or tracing british traditions for now because there's even debate about what britain great or otherwise actually is as far as i can see the situation is this britain his england and wales great britain is england wales and scotland although the great might also simply be there to distinguish britain from brittany the united kingdom is england wales scotland and northern ireland and the british isles is a purely geographical term describing all the countries above with the addition of era and is used only by geographers who want to have to eat their own corduroy elbow patches the next time they go through customs at dublin airport what seems to be clear though is that britain is as the cliche goes and islands nation although if you tried to get an answer to how many islands there actually are the internet gives you hundreds all contradictory some websites eight thousand some modern two thousand while a man from the ordinance survey who answered the question how many islands are there in great britain on an internet forum said there are six thousand two hundred and eighty nine which seems an incredibly large figure but given that the ordnance survey draw the maps and there's only the slimmest chance that this man doesn't work for them at all and is simply a freak who pretends to be a cartographer at weekends of design to go with it this total is roughly one third of the number in indonesia a country so full of tiny islands that a map of the whole thing looks like a blood splatter pattern from signed them witness and six thousand two hundred and sixty three more than switzerland which surprisingly has thirty six although they don't really count because they're all in lakes the majority of the islands of britain however are proper honest to goodness islands surrounded by swell approachable only by boat causeway sea tractor or if you are a nineteen seventies rock star who bought off scotland because being a laird seemed like a good way to splash the cash by helicopter they range in size the big one which contains england scotland and wales two fairly substantial i was like white sheppey and sky to marginally less bulky islands like staffer lundy and brown c try not to think too hard about how that one got it's name to simple lumps of rock that whatever scale of map you're currently struggling the old really only merited dot far less a name that include islands that seem impossibly romantic like lindisfarne which is connected to the northeast coast by causeway described by sir walter scott and those which simply aren't romantic at all like ports ie the island on which portsmouth sit and which would isolate it from the south coast if it wasn't for a short bridge only described by the a book of the road which guides the ferry bound thirty six wheelers over some title mudflats there are islands which appear to be islands but actually aren't like the isle of purbeck and the isle of dogs the first is simply a peninsula where a medieval marketing consultant decided to improve tourist numbers by pretending there was water right round it while the isle of dogs the massive bend in the river thames that forms the backdrop to the cry edits in east enders and where i lived until i was ten is just a bit ahead of the game that is it isn't in ireland yet but will be in thousands of years if the river is left to do it's natural thing and smooth out the massive meander that goes past greenwich sadly the point at which it would cut through to straighten its course just like the diagram you half remember from gcc geography is exactly where they built canary wharf with the current problems in global finance you can't imagine any banks letting the river thames search through their trading rooms however much the rest of us would like to see it there are islands you would think are ours but aren't like the self governing crown dependency of the isle of man jersey in the channel islands and the so called bailiwick of guernsey which encompasses a group of yet smaller islands including sark herm bracco jethro and leo all of which seem to have been named by someone still recovering from dental anaesthetic there are islands which seem to have been named by six year old not the isles of scilly a beautiful archipelago of the western most tip of cornwall made famous by the holidaying harold wilson and bbc is an island parish the silliest comprise st mary's st martins briar tresco and it's two neighbors tresco metro and tresco express okay those last two don't really exist the derivation of the word silly is the matter of some debate though no surprise there,1

B002VA8ZPO,the last division i am too sir forward wolfgang groaned rang me from berlin in november nineteen eighty nine when the wall began to crumble to have to be here he insisted you must see it he took no excuses he even managed to find me a plane ticket at a time when it seemed the whole world wanted to be in berlin to watch and celebrate thanks to him i talked to berlin as as the wall fell heard what it had done to their lives saw the significance of it end through their eyes this experience galvanized me into writing this long considered book on that occasion as on others i relished the warm hospitality and kindness of michael and henrietta burton and thomas strasser a few months before general robert corbett the british military commandant had sent me in a helicopter to see the wall in it's full frightening extent at that time it had seemed impregnable and permanent i am fortunate to have seen divided berlin from the air and on the ground and then to have watched the transformation in the lonely obsessive business of research i have been cheered by all those i interviewed their names are listed at the back of this book here i would like to express my gratitude for the time they spared me for the memories they shared which gave life and meaning to the bare facts and for the sense they communicated of how events looked and felt to those who lived through them in east berlin hans jaco boss and his friends helped me to view the wall from the other political side in west berlin i was put in touch with many witnesses to the city's politicians by the senate that civic model of help and efficiency one of the contacts it made for me was with gunter diet man who provided me with copies of the police records for the crucial period of the building of the wall a treasure trove of information about a great drama and an accurate framework on which to pin the chaotic events of troubled complex days research was a particularly time consuming and frustrating business in the period when the soviet bloc like the wall was collapsing telephone communications with eastern europe were tenuous at best and often required the arcane arts of international operators stringing connections through improbable exchanges and setting up professional conspiracies with counterparts in far away places institutions often shared a few phones between several offices so even if you got through to them it might take half an hour to get the person you wanted names and numbers were not listed in directories and came from personal contacts or as a result of umpteen calls emily kasriel took over my phone and showed admirable persistence in setting up visits to east berlin and moscow cost your soccer off drew up an impeccable program for me and moscow then remade arrangements time and again as interviewees changed them in addition he interpreted with skill and nanny me through the political complications and the metro tanya cross of cinco took me into her flat sight unseen fed me cosseted me and made me laugh until my sides ached back in london sue davison risked her health on my smoke and black coffee and translated german the bbc world service team who made the series the world that came in from the cold was generous with ideas and contacts and allowed me to read the transcripts of all their interviews with key figures of the postwar period deborah rogers and david miller gave encouragement when it was needed i must have permanently damaged their lips by biting them rather than nagged for a faster rate of work remnant phillips two showed remarkable patience and an acute sensitive editor's eye professor lawrence freedman told me that king's college london had acquired the national security archive i have dealing with berlin thus saving me goodness knows how many expensive journeys to the united states and the basil liddell hart library provided cozy peaceful conditions for reading the microfiche is access to documents is not always so easy and agreeable when i needed them neither east german nor soviet papers were available to none official outsiders soviet foreign ministry documents might have been read and summarized for me by russian researchers but at a stiff price gratifying though it would have been to support young russian historians whose grants were meager and likely to dry up i decided that there was no substitute for doing one's own work and from the raw material thanks to hardware can do united german and recent cooperation funding and equipment from international bodies to help the russians prepare their archives for the public the documents i could not see will soon be available to others they will,1

B00DEOVSNC,that civilization perhaps more than any other we shall look at will really set the basis for what a civilization should be that as it should be urban based it should be literate it should be based on intensive agriculture and it also will depend very heavily on trade not just local and regional markets but long distance trade and in men the ways will be astonished to learn that it is in the early cities of sumer the earliest of those civilizations in mesopotamia where many of the basics of organized life or civilized life first emerged between thirty five hundred and thirty one hundred bc we also look at egypt another very ancient civilization and a civil asian well known to people because of the fascination with egyptian objects this goes back at least to the roman age and there is a certifiable not disease but obsession known as a gift to mania first afflicting white robin republican senators and continuing through the roman age right down to the modern age and again this core arts is in the nature of introduction to the origins evolution and achievements of egyptian civilization and therefore although the three lectures we devote an early egypt act as really an entree into other courses that offer far more detailed examination of egyptian life religion and culture also these civilizations are perhaps known through those interested in biblical history and in the great religious traditions of the west and again there will be a lecture dealing with the hebrews and the hebrews are really rather late to the whole cultural scene of this world will start in the so called iron age age at the time of the divided kingdom for those familiar with the terminology of the old testament that is at the time of the kingdom of israel and judah we will look at the historical information we have on the hebrews the evolution of these kingdoms and the basis upon which of the great religious vision of the west that is the transcendent monotheism the god of abraham yahuah as he's known in his hebrew name how that notion comes about among the hebrews and how it is transmitted to later generations perhaps one of the most important if not the all important achievements certainly for western civilization coming out of these great traditions and again this will act as an entree re for those interested in studying the great religious traditions that issue forth from these early hebrews and we will end with the persian empire the persian empires established in the sixth century bc this is an empire that in many ways sums up the achievements of all the early civilizations of the first literate civilizations that go back to ancient sumer in the period known as the earth period from thirty five hundred and thirty one hundred bc the persians will also incorporate egypt all of the other lands that have been influenced or contributed to these early civilizations and with the persian empire with that that great achievement the mo successful state in many ways until the roman empire under king darius who ruled from five twenty one to to forty six bc we shall end this course and that is an appropriate point to stop because king darius is the great king of persia as he would be known in the contemporary records is the great king who whores what the greeks and embarks on this are very very important new chapter in history that is the struggle between the persian empire and the greek city states and that opens up a whole new set of relationships and developments at least in the western tradition so that's a fitting point to stop and above all i think these civilizations we shall examine will invite comparison to other early civilizations those interested in the civilizations of china or later of india even the megalithic stone age civilizations of western europe and above all the civilizations of the america will find many fruitful comparisons in the analysis were going to offer and finally i think it's important all important for all of us to understand the origins of these great traditions that come out of the near east war as many would say today the middle east they do stand behind the traditions of classical greece the greeks themselves acknowledged their great debt to these older civilizations the greeks were fascinated with early egypt and as plato was said in several occasions the greeks never invented anything on their own they got it from the earlier peoples although he adds the provisos that everything the greeks took they improved dealing obviously with a great perspective so this is the aim of the co course and by the end of the course will be able to wrap up what we have learned about these great traditions and how they will influence subject subsequent developments well with that said i think it is best to look at the cradles of these early civilizations and those are three river systems today,1

B00B3VM29C,chapter one using constraints to free up the mind what's the story what is going on in the brain of a jazz pianist this is a tough question for neuroscientists to answer how do you tuck a piano or even a keyboard into the tight enclosure of an m r i machine where the top is only inches from the reclining person's nose how can the jazz artist hear the music he is creating over the din of the m r i contraption itself and if you are doing this research in order to study creativity how can you tell that what you are seeing in the brain scan reflects actual improvisation and not simply the playing of a prearranged jazz piece these were the challenges faced by researchers charles lamb and alan braun as they plan their study of jazz improvisation they met the first challenge by leaning a specially designed non magnetic keyboard against the slightly raised knees of the reclined musicians the researchers suspended a mirror above the area so that the jazz artists could see the keys reflected their new musicians wear earphones these allowed them to hear the music they were creating the earphones also allow the musicians to hear a prerecorded jazz quartet accompaniment this accompaniment made the situation more similar to the conditions in which the musicians warden narrowly played the researchers wanted to see if there were parts of the brain specifically involved in improvisation rather than in simply playing jazz to do this they had the musicians play two pieces a jazz piece they had previously memorized and a piece that they improvised on the spot what did the researchers find as expected some areas of the brain were active no matter what the musicians played these were the areas involved in looking at the keyboard touching the keys and listening to the music in the improvisational piece there was also activity that possibly reflected the brain encoding new combinations of sounds but there were three other areas that were noticeably different to when the musicians improvised compared to when they played the memorized piece lemon braun found that the medial prefrontal cortex an area of the brain that is a few inches behind the center of the forehead was much more active during improvisation some investigators have associated this part of the brain with self expression and with an intentional focus on inner thoughts and sensations rather than external stimuli in some ways this is similar to what mikheil chicks at me hai called flow when creative artists are in a state of flow they're not consciously thinking ahead about the next note to play or the next brushstroke to make on a painting this doesn't mean that their actions are random they don't play just any old note instead it is as if they are being guided by a set of internalized rules or strategies these rules influenced the result but the artist doesn't need to consciously will each intention into an action it also turns out that what is not happening in the brain may be just as important as what is happening while the medial prefrontal cortex was more active there were two parts of the brain that were significantly less active when the musicians improvised compared to when they played the memorized piece one of these areas the aw orbital frontal cortex is involved with monitoring our behavior to keep it socially appropriate this is the area that prompts us to worry about what others think of us it tells us to behave to stifle a giggle at a funeral and not to swear in front of grandma during these tests this part of the prefrontal cortex was less active when the musicians improvised perhaps because being concerned about judgment from others inhibits creativity there was a second area that was quiet during improvisation the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex this part of the brain is involved in what are sometimes called the brain's executive functions one we are consciously pursuing a goal planning to achieve it and monitoring our progress this part of the brain is at work in children the prefrontal cortex is not fully developed,0
B07DGJFG5Z,not the rule this is a fascinating chapter in a long running story because the middle east has served as an arena for great power conflict since the beginning of recorded time in the first half of the twentieth century britain and france were the great powers of the day midway through the first world war they carved up the ottomans arab territory between them and once they had won the war then subdivided it into mandates which they went on to rule for the best part of thirty years the french left in nineteen forty six chased out by lebanese and syrian nationalists who had had surreptitious british help any british sense of victory was short lived because a new contest with the united states then followed britain's original motive for wanting to control the middle east was primarily strategic by dominating a belt of territory stretching from egypt to iran she could control the route between europe and india yet by the time that indian independence in nineteen forty seven rendered that rationale redundant another justification had already taken its place oil british companies domination of middle eastern oil production generated vital revenues for the crown improved britain's perennially poor balance of payments and would enable the country to defend itself in the event of a war with soviet russia the belief that oil was as one minister put it a wasting asset that would run out by about the end of the century if it had not already been superseded by atomic energy which many people at that time expected would be powering cars by now encourage short term thinking and one hope in particular the b british might manage to resist mounting nationalist pressures for longer than the oil flowed out the ground oil and the vast profits that it generated influence almost everything that happens after nineteen forty seven in this story they were a constant source of tension between washington and london compared to the british government which owned a majority of the biggest oil company operating in the region and through it held a stake in another the united states seemed far less organized the goals of its government and oil industry were frequently at odds once the americans had realized the sheer scale of likely regional oil oil reserves the speculative concession won by a us company aramco to hunt for oil in saudi arabia acquired a new strategic significance whereas short termism led the british to defend their own interests aggressively the americans prime interest was initially commercial which made them more realistic and flexible aramco came under pressure from the saudis from the late nineteen forties onwards but knowing it could count on the united states government's support ago great to split its profits fifty fifty with the saudi king not only did this suddenly increase the money that the saudis could spend to advance their own regional ambitions which caused huge political instability but it also set a precedent that the american companies british rivals refused to follow that miscarriage elation triggered a series of events starting with iran's nationalization of anglo iranian that first stripped britain of that crucial imperial asset prestige and left the region's once great and now denuded power fighting increasingly desperately to cling on the americans knowingly abetted this process a fact that eden despite his later claim of ignorance knew full well at the time six months after the crucial battle of el alamein at a time when the british still directly ruled palestine and occupied half of persia and whispered in the ears of the kings of egypt jordan and iraq the foreign secretary wrote a memorandum in which he acknowledged how difficult the anglo american relationship in the middle east had become in it he summed up the threat to britain's position in the region as being a major nationalistic revival of two contending forces arab ism and xy zionism stoked by zionist propagandists in the united states as eden's use of the word revival implied the british had seen both before what was new and ominous in the foreign secretary's eyes was how the zionists were now successfully courting the support of the united states and in due course the leading arab nationalist of the era edens nemesis gamal abdel nasser would as well the british intended to enlist the americans to deal with both these threats they hoped to thwart zionist ambitions by persuading the us government,1
B06Y16VB3P,if you can do that you will be bullet proof but if you cannot you will wake up one morning with a pink slip and no idea how you will continue providing your family with the bare essentials if you are in business for yourself you must constantly look at the va value of what you are providing the same holds true when you're operating in a high degree of self efficacy what's important is the tiger is constantly on the prowl and so should you be so this brings us to the key questions how do you scan the horizon how do you keep track of your value how do you continuously monitor the value you bring and the demand for your services while you are busy doing your job one thing that is actually important to understand here is that it is valuable for your current employer for you to be scanning the horizon and confirming that you are clearly bringing value to your current role most employers would rather you continue to assess your value and ensure that you are important to their bottom line if you miss that opportunity you might become obsolete if you have a better sense of your current value you can continue to improve your contribution and that will be good for you and your employer but let's go back to the tiger like mindset concept to better under your stand how to scan the horizon if you were a tiger and were hunting for prey you would constantly be scanning the horizon and ensuring that your plan is the most viable considering all of the factors that are facing you in essence you must be looking at the value that you bring to the job market is the tiger's prey changing their habits are there new competitors on the horizon is technology making your approach to the job market less valuable or even obsolete tigers would have to constantly face many of these factors and in order to survive they must be vigilant as a result the actions they take are not only good for themselves but also their young tigers constantly look for ways to improve their hunting techniques which continue to provide them with a viable source of food you too must constantly ensure that the product or service you are providing to the job market remains current viable and valuable this concept all plays out in the career acceleration plan remember that your employer is your prey in a good sense scanning the horizon and continuing to ensure that you are bringing value to your employer is good for you and for your employer also i have a word of caution for you if you simply rely on the value that got you the position in the first place you will become obsolete there simply is too much change going on in the world for that obsolescence not to happen you have to change change you have to remain current and relevant this is important for your career and will ensure you continue to bring value to your current employer and to potential future employers as opportunities present themselves,0
B00BR34SU2,when i turned to writing about the app i saw that the number of proceeding books on the assault raised the question of whether a new book was required but a closer look showed that most of these titles dated back several decades and most authors had set out to argue a particular case within the numerous outstanding debates axes were being ground too often this led to a selective spotlighting of some military reports and participant accounts at the expense of others there was no shortage of historical material to draw upon hundreds of pages were generated during the planning of the attack in the aftermath a great effort was made to collect and preserve survivor recollections countless after action reports examined the assault in general or concentrated on specific aspects how had communication systems functioned was intelligence on german defenses accurate what lessons could be learned and applied to future amphibious operations these and many other questions were examined in microscopic detail given this bounty i decided to focus on the historical record and draw from it my own conclusions i believe this enabled me to examine the controversial questions with a largely unbiased eye it is difficult though for a canadian to write about the app and not be affected by the scope of the tragedy suffered in that sing angle bitter day but it is important to remember that the app is not purely a canadian army story i included here a considerable number of non canadian experiences so the df might be understood in it's fuller context unfortunately few df veterans are still alive and memories have greatly faded but i found the personal you are their style that enriched the other books in the series was still achievable the many accounts of soldiers sailors and airmen gathered in the aftermath of the assault ensured this ultimately i could select only a sampling from literally hundreds of personal stories like the earlier books this one is a tribute to those brave young men who went to war to make a better world,1
B076FFR78C,or opportunity finding answers to these questions is an easy innovating is complex messy and often opaque that said i'm going to explain this process step by step and show exactly what it takes to replicated inside your company i'll make clear how you can take these lists lessons and apply them to any established organization from start ups and family owned businesses to multinational corporations the reason i believe i'm a good teacher is because i have done the work myself i cofounded three different venture funded startups i've been in the trenches struggling to find the right path for my companies i know how hard it can be i witnessed the rise and collapse of the dot com bubble i lived through through the two thousand and eight financial crisis i rode several of the biggest tech waves and i've taken all my experience successors and travails and use them as the foundation for my teaching i've also worked for large public companies including info space and sega coached managers from multinationals like i b m fujitsu and walkway and helped numerous family owned companies across asia because of my diverse background i'm able to look at innovation from both both the perspective of a bootstrapped entrepreneur and a corporate executive in this book i approach innovation from both points of view i show how innovation works in startups as well as in some of the world's largest conglomerates so what is founder space founder space is an incubator and accelerator for startup companies most people don't understand exactly what incubators and accelerators do so i will explain incubators like bill gross's idealab typically begin with their own ideas and then put together the team funding resources and relationships necessary to transform a concept into a successful business accelerators don't form companies instead they recruit already existing companies which are at an early stage in their development and provide them with the mentoring resources relationships training and funding necessary to accelerate their growth how did i get started forming my own incubator and accelerator five years ago after i'd finished my third venture funded startup i was taking a break at this time many of my friends were launching their own startups in silicon valley and they came to me for assistance steve you have to help me my friends would say how do i get funded how do you put together a business plan who should i have on my board of advisors i was happy to answer their questions on fundraising product development design and go to market strategy after a couple months of this i realized that most entrepreneurs have the same questions so i posted answers to those questions on my blog some of the posts went viral soon new startup founders whom i didn't know began asking me for help that was when founder space was born my colleagues and i started holding meet ups in san francisco and silicon valley our events and roundtables became so popular that they spread to los angeles new york texas and as far away as singapore over the years founders space grew from a part time hobby and labor of love into a more than full time global business founder space has more than fifty strategic partners around the world our headquarters are in san francisco our first goal was to help startups from all over the world to tap into the silicon valley ecosystem as we expanded so did our mission we are now an international organization with those strategic partners in twenty two countries we believe innovators need to think globally and found her space has become an educational and knowledge sharing hub for worldwide entrepreneurship europe has been a big focus for us and now we're expanding rapidly in asia we run in-depth courses across china taiwan and korea and we launched a founder space incubator in shanghai with plans to open up in japan and germany our mission is to continue expanding globally with southeast asia and latin america next on our list within the past two years we've,0

1469073862,for the completion of the project although some consultants resist this method of pricing due to the risk involved if the price is too low my experience shows that this is the trend tom peters says it's a project based world if you're not spending at least seventy percent of your time on projects if you're living in the past you may have to bid on a fixed price basis if you work for government agencies responding to a request for proposal rfp from any organization may also require you to determine a fixed price for an entire project but it may also require you to to break the work down to show how much you are charging per hour an rfp is often used when several consultants are competing for a job i preferred this pricing structure for several reasons first and most important the clients employees can call at any time for assistance and unlike my a attorney i won't start the timer second the method is performance and results oriented we are paid for what we accomplish third this method is the best match for accustomed design forth this method is better for larger contracts several large contracts are easier to match image then dozens of little ones how can you determine a price first estimate how much time you expect the project to require if this is your first time with this method you may still want to use a daily rate to find a ballpark price with this method you assume the risk of the total cost of the project ethically you cannot not charge more than the original quoted price even if you lose money we have lost money on a couple of projects due to poor estimating in these situations we have always continued to provide the highest quality work and have not disclosed our predicament to the client this would be unprofessional it certainly taught us good estimating skills quickly the one drawback is scope creep that's when your client asks you to do more than what was agreed upon these things happen because neither you nor the client will be able to predict everything this can be managed easily as long as you bring each of these additional client requests that go beyond your original agreement to your clients attention at that point you can both decide how to manage the new requests they may be included in the project add an additional fee or they may be left for a later time per person charging by the number of participants who attend the session is another way to look at pricing for a training consultant it is typically used by trainers offering public seminars although there may be a few nonprofits that like to contract this way to government agencies may want you to use this type of fee structure her because it more closely matches their budgeting structure if you do choose this method consider an upfront agreement that you will be paid for a minimum number of participants in other words if you require payment for a minimum of eighteen and only sixteen people attend you will still be pay paid for eighteen of course you should also specify a maximum number of participants i deliver training for a talent development professionals in china where it is critical to specify the exact maximum number you will accept i remember conducting a two day session that was supposed to be for thirty five participants as i was setting up i thought we had a very large room for thirty five participants and then i learned why as the session began fifty additional people started to stream into the room standing against walls and sitting on the floor around the perimeter my contract had been interpreted as thirty five official participants who would be seated at tables and as many unofficial spectators as would fit in the room retainers i see more and more retainer arrangements a retainer establishes a set fee that the consultant receives on a regular basis generally monthly a retainer works best if you've already completed one or more initial projects with your client because it allows how's both of you to get to know each other and the business culture a retainer or pay for access typically covers a span of twelve months the client is assured that the consultant is available on an as needed basis the client and consultant determine an approximate amount of time that will be required monthly but given enough advance warning the console,0
B077P5GGGM,witches and bloody battles which terminated lee's first invasion of maryland the discipline of our army was excellent and it would have been hard to find a finer body of men or better fighting material than that assembled on this occasion in readiness to open the spring campaign hooker was justly popular with his troops they had confidence in his ability as a general and he again their goodwill by anticipating their wants and by generously granting furloughs to those who were pining from homesickness trusting that old associations and the honor of the men would induce them to rejoin their colors when the leaves of absence had expired in this way he almost stopped the desertion which had been so prevalent under burnside only one portion of the army was dissatisfied the position recently occupied by general friends siegel the favorite commander of the eleventh corps had been given to general o o howard the numerous germans in that corps or were discontented at the change they cared little for howard's reputation as the havelock of the army and appalachian he had gained from his zeal as a congregationalist they felt when their countryman siegel was deprived of his command that it was a blow to their nationality and therefore lost some of the enthuse z as in which always accompanies the personal influence of a popular leader the rainy season was nearly over the time had come for action and it was essential to strike a decisive blow before the term of service of the nine months and two years men had drawn to a close hookers plan of campaign was simple efficacious and should have been successful the rebels occupied a long line and could not be strong everywhere he resolved to make a pretense of crossing with three corps under major general sedgwick below fredericksburg while the remaining four corps under major general slocum made a detour and crossed twenty seven miles above at kelly's ford the latter were then to march down the river against the left flank of the rebel army and reopened banks' ford thus reuniting the two wings of the army and giving a secure line of retreat in case of disaster when this was accomplished it was proposed to give battle in the open country near the ford the position there being a ending one and taking the whole line of rebel works on the heights of fredericksburg in reverse owing to his great preponderance of force hooker had little reason to doubt that the result will be favorable to our arms to carry out this plan and make it a complete surprise to the enemy it became necessary to leave gibbons division of couches core behind or as his encampment at falmouth was in full view of the confederate forces on the opposite side to withdraw it would have been to notify them that some unusual movement was going on so far the idea was simply to crush the opposing army but hookers plan went farther and involve the capture of lee's entire force to accomplish this he directed stoneman to start two weeks in advance of the main body with ten thousand cavalry cross at the upper fords of the rappahannock and sweep do down upon lee's communications with richman breaking up railroads and canals cutting telegraph wires and intercepting supplies of all kinds as the rebel commissariat found great difficulty in keeping more than four days rations on hand at a time stolons raid would almost necessarily force lee to fall all back on his depth pose and give up fredericksburg one column under admiral was to attack culpeper and gordonsville the other under buford to move to louisa courthouse and thence to the fredericksburg railroad both columns were to unite behind the pr monkey and incase our army was successful stoneman was directed to plant his force behind some river in in an advantageous position on lee's line of retreat where he could detain the rebel army until hooker could again assail it and compel it to surrender a brave program let us see how it was carried out it was an essential part of hooker's project that the cavalry should begin operations two weeks before the infantry if they did their work thoroughly lee would be out of provisions and his retreat would give us all the moral effect of a victory the rebel cavalry at the time being reduced to about three thousand men it was not supposed that stoneman would encounter any serious resistance he accordingly started on april thirteenth to carry out his instructions but another rainstorm which made the river unforeseeable and very bad roads detained him until the twenty eighth it has been suggested that he might have crossed higher up,1
B01MTFBLJI,after the war vander haida said he was most proud of the fact that postwar interviews and records showed the ghost army was never found out by the enemy which he said was a remarkable testament to their stealth and ability to keep a secret it had eleven officers and two hundred and eighty five enlisted men company a two hundred and ninety third engineer combat battalion headed by captain george a reb a native of detroit michigan and a nineteen forty three graduate of west point this company was chosen from a battalion that had been activated a year before and had gone through tennessee and desert maneuvers it was a hearty disciplined group of combat engineers which the twenty third needed for security and rough jobs it was probably readers' favorite part of the ghost army because it was not as deeply engaged in deception as other units because of this reb is one of the few officers who can say that readers showed a genuine liking for him and his men it became the four hundred and sixth engineer combat company special it had five officers and one hundred sixty three enlisted men among the combat and perimeter safety personnel was colorful and feisty lieutenant dick syracuse who was a legend in the ghost army as the reader will find out later in this narrative and still leads an active life as an attorney in new rochelle new york the thirty one hundred and thirty second signal service company was headed by major charles r williams of warsaw indiana it was the only unit within the twenty third that was formed solely for the purpose of deception and not adapted for it later it was activated separately at the army experimental station at pine camp new york in march nineteen forty four it did not ge join the rest of the twenty third until august nineteen forty four after d day in france it had eight officers and one hundred thirty seven enlisted men williams who died in nineteen eighty seven was one of the most popular officers he was a graduate of st john's military academy and washington and lee yoona diversity after the war he became publisher of the warsaw times union a daily newspaper in north central indiana he came by his military prowess naturally his grandfather was general brevet reuben williams who commanded the indiana twelfth infantry regiment during the civil war the er army also allowed the men forming the ghost army extraordinary powers to bring certain talented individuals into the service in order to use their special skills actors were recruited and some of these actors later drove around in jeeps pretending to be generals to lend credence to phony battle divisions some of the phone the generals were young men in their twenties skillfully made up and driven in cars with the appropriate number of stars in territory near the front lines simon and still leads an active life in boulder colorado at the age of ninety a west pointer simon son was quarterback of his valley city north dakota high school he had been accepted to west point from north dakota but was able to get in a year earlier in nineteen thirty through a political appointment by an indiana congressman simonds and planned several field problems based upon the simulated appearance under various tactical conditions of units ranging from division to core these pro problems were not particularly satisfying because it was hard to make the mental transition from real soldier to dummy troops or nazi bait as some of the troops later called themselves the results looked like so much window dressing with no place to go officers who had once commanded thirty two ton tanks felt frustrated and help atlas with a battalion of rubber em fours weighing just ninety three pounds fully inflated the adjustment from man of action to man of while was most difficult at first few realized in those early days that one could spend just as much energy pretending to fight as actually fighting but formation of the twenty third also was facilitated by the fact that no one knew much about how it was to appear roach its mission outside the limited experience in north africa for example here is one officer's take on how it first got through to george marshall lieutenant colonel merrick h truly executive officer major charles h yoakam signal officer and david h bridges flew to washington to present the modified plan after urging by general devers and the british american major ralph ingersoll also was an ardent promoter of the idea the plan worked it's way up the chain of command after marshall's okay and the approval of secretary of war stimson it was eased through the war department with practically no opposition because no one,1

B00D9179II,the years what we actually mean by modern the modern age modern europe and talks about it quite frequently but what actually does it mean at some point in the nineteenth century intellectuals artists scientists and political figures begin to use the term in a very self conscious way to describe a set of interrelated developments that had kuala totally and quantitatively changed both the style and substance of social economic cultural and political life in europe those changes they realized had not come about overnight but were the result of a complex series of developments that stretched back at least to the protestant reformation of the early sixteenth century those changes beginning with the protestant reformation were extraordinary in their proportions the protestant reformation of the sixteenth century was a reverse revolution of immense proportions and it was not merely a theological dispute but a momentous assault on the very foundations of intellectual and spiritual life in the west affecting everyone from the most humble peasant to the most powerful noble lord in the process it posed a revolutionary social and political challenge to the established secular powers of the west ushering in almost two centuries of conflict religious war indeed we might say ideological war one might argue that the wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries represent the first modern ideological conflicts in our history and in their wake the unity of the medieval world of christendom of the west was forever shattered in the sixteenth century at least until the protestant reformation europeans would have defined themselves first and foremost as christendom it was a christian civilization the protestant reformation of the sixteenth century would bring that sense of unity that sense of definition of what is europe to an unhappy close then in the seventeenth century a century so filled with cultural anguish and intellectual ferment so soaked in the blood of truly ghastly wars that in no small way it resembles our own twentieth century new structures of political organization would emerge that would make the raw mark the rise of the state the modern state that in very altered form is still very much with us today the seventeenth century would also see the emergence of the so-called scientific revolution that would challenge spiritual basis of western thought throwing into question the received wisdom of centuries evolving into the philosophical movement became to be known as the enlightenment those changes had begun a fundamental transformation of european life restructuring values attitudes and practices in a way that had revolutionary implications at the close of the eighteenth century where our course begins the implications of those far reaching historical developments erupted with dramatic force in the dual revolutions that shaped the contours of modern european the western and global life in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries it would fall fine come to define what we really mean by the modern world the first of those revolutions of course was the french revolution the great revolution of seventeen eighty nine to seventeen ninety nine with its assault on the political institution of monarchy and the social position of aristocracy it challenged the two fundamental social and political institutions of the established order and in established order which shortly after the outbreak of revolution would be referred to as the austrian regime or the old regime a pejorative definition of a society that would not change and had finally been pushed aside by these revolutionary developments the second great revolution of this period a revolution that is nowhere nearly as easy to define chronologically the industrial revolution roughly from the period from seventeen fifty to eighteen fifty with it's origins in england just across the channel would also fundamentally alter the economic and social base his first in europe and in the world these two revolutions the french and industrial revolutions are traditionally seen by scholars and others as the two revolutions that defined the beginnings of the modern distinguish it that the dividing line the watershed between the old established order early modern europe is sometimes referred to as the modern period these two momentous developments these two interlocking revolutions however are difficult to imagine without an equally profound transformation indeed revolution in thought,1

B00I5S4D6Q,she shouldn't have been tempted this is what kestrel thought as she swept the sailors silver off the impromptu gaming table set up in a corner of the market don't go said one sailor stay said another but kestrel cinched her wrist strap velvet purse shot the sun had lowered and caramelized the color of things which meant that she'd played cards long enough to be noticed by someone who mattered someone who would tell her father cards wasn't even her favorite game as silver wouldn't begin to pay for her silk dress snagged from the splintery crate she'd used as a stool but sailors were much better adversaries than the average aristocrat they flipped cards with feral tricks swore when they lost swore when they won would gouge the last silver keystone coin out of a friend and and they cheated kestrel especially liked it when they cheated it made beating them not quite so easy she smiled and left them then her smile faded this hour of thrilling risk was going to cost her it wasn't the gambling that would infuriate her father or the company she had camped no general trajan was going to want to know why his daughter was in the city market alone other people wondered till she she saw it in their eyes as she threaded through market stalls offering open sacks of spice the scents mingling with salty air that wafted from the nearby port kestrel guessed the words people didn't dare whisper as she passed of course they didn't speak they knew who she was and she knew what they would say were were as lady kestrels escort and if she had no friend or family available to escort her to the market where was her slave well as for a slave they had been left at her villa kestrel did not need them as for the whereabouts of her escort she was wondering the same thing jess had wand rudolph to look at the wares castro last saw her weaving like a flower drunk be through the stalls her pale blonde hair almost white in the summer sun technically jessica get in as much trouble as kestrel it wasn't allowed for a young valori and girl who wasn't a member of the military to walk alone but just as parents stowed good on her and they hardly had the same notion of discipline as the highest ranking general in the valori an army kestrel scanned the stalls for her friend and finally caught the gleam of blonde raids styled in the latest fashion just was talking to a jewelry seller who dangled a pair of earrings the translucent gold droplets caught the light kestrel drew closer to paz the elderly woman was saying to jess to brighten your lovely brown eyes only ten keystones there was a hard set to the jewelry sellers mouth kestrel met the woman's gray eyes and noticed that her wrinkled skin was brown from years working outdoors she was hirani but a brand on her wrist proved that she was free kestrel wondered how she'd earned that freedom slaves freed by their masters were rare jess glanced up orchestral she breed i'm these earrings perfect maybe if the the weight of silver and kestrels purse hadn't dragged at her wrist she would have said nothing maybe if that drag at her wrist hadn't also dragged at her heart with dread castro would have thought before she spoke but instead she blurted what was the obvious truth there not to pass their glass there was a sudden bubble of silence it expanded grew thin and sheer people around them were listening the earrings trembled in mid air because the jewelry sellers bony fingers were trembling because kestrel had just accused her of trying to cheat of a laurean and what would happen next what would happen to any hirani in this woman's position then what with the crowd witness an officer of the city guard called to the scene a plea of innocence ignored old hands bound to the whipping post lashes until blood darkened the market dirt let me see kestrels hand or voice imperious because she was very good at being imperious she reached for the earrings and pretended to examine them ah it seems i was mistaken indeed they are topaz take them whispered to the jewelry seller we are not poor we have no need of a gift from someone such as you kestrel set coins on the woman's table the bubble of silence broke oak and shoppers return to discussing whatever where had caught their fancy kestrel gave the earrings to jess and led her away as they walked just studied one earring letting it swing like a tiny bow so they are real know how can you tell they're completely unclouded castro sand no flaws ten keystones was too cheap a price for topaz of that quality chess might have commented that ten keystones was too great a price for glass but she said only the hirani would say that the god of lies must love you you see things so clearly kestrel remembered the woman's stricken grey eyes the hirani tell too many stories they had been dreamers her father i always said that this was why they had been easy to conquer everyone loves stories jess and kestrel stopped to take the earrings from jess and slipped them into her friend's ears then why are these to the next society dinner tell everyone you paid an outrageous sum and they will believe they're true jewels isn't that what's stories do make real things fake and fake things real jess smiled turning her head from side to side so that the earrings glittered,0
B07CZ4C5XF,well sophistication and appreciation one way it can do this is by providing us with useful political analogies i've recently begun writing op-eds that make comparisons between athenian democracy and our current political climate and leadership analogies can be mischievous i wrote one op ed ed in which i compared donald trump to the super rich athenian celebrity and politician lc bodies but they can also be extremely illuminating and they can tell us that a lot of things we think anew have been around a very long time so i want to make the claim at this start of a journey that by studying athenian democracy you will be also studying the concept of democracy itself specifically modern western liberal democracy and no matter that the athenian system was vastly different from our own so wherever appropriate i will make analogies between athenian democracy and ours whether to point out a similarity or to highlight a difference i'll do this however from a non partisan point of view i don't believe it is the business of an educator to promote a political agenda another point i want to make is that this course is not going to extol the virtues of athenian democracy far from it i'm not going to encourage you to bow down before the athenians that's not how i teach greek history instead i intend to present as objective a picture as i can of it's achievements and failures and of its aspirations and limitations it's that complex and contradictory record that deserves close study particular particularly at a time when western democracy is being tested in ways that are perhaps without precedent i'd like to begin by making some basic points about the character of athenian democracy first we need to note that it had both a political and a legal base the political base was the right of direct participation in the decision making process the legal base was equality before the law and the right to be judged by a jury of your peers these were the twin pillars of athenian democracy i am reminded of a statement by justice antonin scalia a jury as he maintained were the same spinal column of american democracy i feel sure the athenians would have characterized jurors in the same way second the confidence that athenian democracy invested in the ordinary unqualified and inexperienced male was unprecedented and would remain unique in human society at least we might say up until the two thousand and sixteen election as the swiss historian kurt ralph lau b writes no police that's to say no city state had ever dared to give all it's citizens equal political rights regardless of their descent wealth social standing education personal qualities and any other factors that usually determined status in the community the corollary is that no other people have ever been so politicized over such a long period third athenian democracy wasn't in the least bit communist or socialist in tendency the athenians didn't believe in the redistribution of wealth their democracy wasn't anti wealth or anti aristocracy that said though there was some state ownership as there still is in the u s notably twenty eight percent of the nation's total land including us as much as eighty four percent of nevada so for instance the day most the athenian citizen body owned athens is very lucrative silver mines and anyone who wished to mine there had to bid for the right to do so and pay the state the money he bid next the athenian demos also taxed brothels in addition there was a belief in the common good the individual was in the service of the state to a degree that would be frankly unacceptable to us or to any modern democracy most of i don't have the time to involve ourselves in democracy even at the local level whereas an athenian was required to,1

B002V0RI8E,america is different today when american exceptionalism as it is called has become the subject of academic study the united states except in wealth and military power is less exceptional than it was in the years when it was to be reached only by sailing ship across the atlantic then before american culture had been universalist by hollywood the technology of television and the international music industry america really was a different place and society from the old world which had given birth europeans who made the voyage noted differences of every sort not only political and economic but human and social as well americans were bigger than europeans even their slaves were bigger than their african forebears thanks to the superabundance of food that american farms produced american parents allowed their children the freedom not known in europe they shrank from punishing their sons and daughters in the ways european fathers and mothers did ulysses s grant the future general and chief of the union armies and president of the united states recalled in his memoirs that there was never any scolding or punishment by my parents no objection to rational enjoyments such as fishing going to the creek a mile away to swim in summer taking a horse and visiting my grandparents it's in the adjoining county fifteen miles off skating on the ice in winter taking a horse and sleigh when there was snow on the ground it was a description of childhood as experienced in the most prosperous country dwelling families of the period the grants were modestly well-to-do jesse grant the future president's father having a tanning business and also working in extensive property of arable land and forest but then most established american families and the grants had come to the new world in sixteen thirty were prosperous it was prosperity that underlay the easy way with their offspring since they were not obliged to please neighbors by constraining their children the children of the prosperous were nevertheless well behaved because they were schooled and churchgoing the two went together though not in lockstep lincoln was a notably indulgent father though he was not a doctrinal christian churchgoing america overwhelmingly protestant before eighteen fifty needed to read the book bible and north of the mason dixon line which informally divided north from south four-fifths of americans could read and write almost all american children in the north and effectively all in new england went to school a far higher proportion than in europe where literacy even in britain france and germany lay around too two thirds america was also becoming college going with the seats of higher education harvard yale columbia princeton the college of william and mary established and flourishing america could afford to fund and run colleges because it was already visibly richer than europe rich agriculturally though was not yet a food exporting economy and increasingly rich industrially it was a newspaper country with a vast newspaper reading public and a large number of local and some widely distributed city newspapers it's medical profession was large and skilful and the inventiveness and mechanical aptitude of it's population was remarked upon by all visitors so too was the vibrant and passionate nature of it's politics america was already a country of ideas and movements highly conscious of it's birth in freedom and it's legacy of revolution anti imperialism had been it's founding principle during the decades before the civil war america was experiencing an industrial boom and it's own distinctive industrial revolution england's industrial revolution had taken it's impetus from the development of steam power fueled by the island's abundant deposits of coal and directed to the exploitation of it's large deposits of metal ores early nineteenth century america was also beginning to dig coal and iron ore of which it's soil contained enormous quantities but at the outset it was to other sources of power which drove it's proliferating factories and workshops water power and wood the rivers of new england new york and pennsylvania were harnessed to turn water wheels and it's extensive forest to supply timber for burning in europe the days were long gone when forests could be cut down to supply heat the continent outside scandinavia and the russian interior was highly deforested in america trees were still in encumbrance which had to be felled to provide land for farming but which also when sorn provided the raw material for every sort of building and manufactured item america needed deforestation if it soils would it be farmed in the future and in that process industrialization and land clearing went hand in hand during the eighteen thirties and later new york city consumed several million loads of wood every year cotton stripped from maine and new jersey it was only gradually that mines were dug and extended originally by immigrants from the english coalfields and welsh valleys but by eighteen sixty production in the pennsylvania anthracite fields had increased forty fold in thirty years by that date a distinctive economic geography of the united states could be discerned with expanding industrial regions centered on new york and philadelphia exploded coalfields in new jersey pennsylvania and the allegheny region of the appalachians a developing industrial region around pittsburgh and a thriving textile and engine nearing zone in southern new england in the north the proportion of farm workers in the labor force had fallen below forty per cent while it remained above eighty per cent in the south an economic map would show that there was no industrial center south of a line drawn from st louis to louisville to baltimore in the south nine tenths of the population lived in the countryside but in the north only a quarter timber also provided the steam power for paddle boats which by aging fifty were to be seen on every navigable waterway and the railway locomotives which were becoming familiar on the tracks which were stretching out to link all the more important cities to one another and to the seaboard ports by eighteen fifty there were nine thousand miles of track in the united states by eighteen sixty thirty thousand rivers and then canals had been the means of transportation and distribution in the early stages of the boom canal boats and river steamers were rapidly overtaken in importance by the railroad by

B07FCQ4CNQ,the twenty seventh was the third day of a three day mission and all the members of the unit were tired and ready to return to f o b escan at some point that morning a majority of the snipers were gathered and somewhat camouflaged in the field of high grass resting pulling security and eating flores was on a high area of ground and was the first to observe an iraqi man cutting grass about three hundred meters away within a few minutes all of the snipers had their eyes trained on the man according to flores the man was not doing anything out of the ordinary according to the prosecution as the morning dragged on and hensley watched the man cutting grass in the field he decided that he would kill the man for no real reason hensley made visual contact with sandoval and directed him to follow him away from the others they both low crawled through the high grass toward the man hensley and sand have all got into shooting positions lying down with their sniper rifles pointed at the man a few minutes later hensley asked sand of all if he had the shot sand of all immediately fired and hit the man squarely in the head the impact of the round ripped most of the man's head and half killing him instantly according to the prosecution ends lay in sand of all quickly approached the body once there hence the ordered sand of all the place command wire on the man's body sand of all complied the wire was presumably placed on the body to make it appear that the deceased man was an insurgent involved with planting i e d's that was the government's theory a few days prior to sandoval's removal from his mother's house by c i d agents on twenty six june two thousand and seven sandoval's life took a dramatic turn although he was completely unaware of it around twenty two june two thousand and seven two soldiers had been reprimanded for minor disciplinary infractions on the frb in response to being punished they told their chain of command that they had overheard hensley sand of all and other soldiers talking about the shootings that they did not feel were justified the soldiers also reported seeing enemy weapons and ammunition in the possession of hensley and others that should have been reported and turned in to the command see id immediately open an investigation into a number of the units recent shootings as well as the unauthorized weapons and it was that investigation which led the agents to arrest sand of all in laredo texas on twenty six june two thousand and seven following the two hour interrogation of sand of all conducted by c id agents at the local laredo police station the agent said typed up a statement and sandoval had signed it in the statement sand have all stated that at the time of the shot all he could see was the head of the individual and that he did not see a weapon on the man sand have all stated that hensley had direct did the shot and admitted that hensley gave me command wire i laid the wire next to the body specialist jorge g sand of all junior sandoval stated in his sworn statement to see ideas follows on twenty seven april two thousand and seven my sniper team which consisted of two heavy teams and one bolt team were supposed to do a mortar interdiction mission on the twenty seventh we got a call the adjacent teams were moving up route lori while the adjacent team was en route we heard machine gun fire the mid team got a call from mohawk six lieutenant matthew didier who stated the iraqi army was in contact with army insurgents we then started to move back south and staff sergeant hensley got a call from someone on the heavy team and stated someone was moving in our direction and this coincided with what loot jenna didier had said it was not too long afterward that we saw a guy walking and then he popped a squat we got in place at which time i could only see the head of the individual sergeant hensley asked if i had the shot i said no,1
B002VA9YCM,weathered him a bit he made both head and tail of it so wise was he so wise and solemn each thought filled just a spinal column if one brain found the pressure strong it passed a few ideas along if something slipped it's forward mind was rescued by the one behind and if an error he was caught he had a saving afterthought as he thought twice before he spoke he had no judgment to revoke for he could think without congestion upon both sides of every question tho gaze upon this model beast defunct ten million years at least well it's been defunct for a lot longer than ten million years that's one thing that burt less than taylor got wrong and the other thing he got wrong is it didn't have two brains but it certainly was an odd creature nonetheless and that's what appeals to us about dinosaurs they're big they're scary they're odd looking and we tend to think of them as dumb not just a little dumb but really dumb and of course they're all extinct they lived millions of years ago when the world was full of ferns and volcanoes why do dinosaurs fascinate us we can't go out and see them or can we one of the reasons may be that children get so interested in dinosaurs as they like to say the names think about it dinosaurs are about the only animals in our lives that we referred to by their scientific or latinized names we don't call a blue jay still ariana cyana siddur we call it a blue jay but we don't call a stegosaurus a roofed lizard or a roofed reptile that's what it's name means we call call it a stegosaurus incidentally the name stegosaurus refers to the plates on the back of the animal even the name dinosaur is interesting to say most people know that the name dinosaur comes from the latin for terrible lizard or fearfully great reptile think about some of the names of other dinosaurs i'll bet you've heard of triceratops triceratops means three horned face the big rhinoceros like dinosaur that had two horns poking above each eye and one horn on its nose and then there's a pata source probably better known to many people as brontosaurus that's actually a dinosaur that was named twice we'll talk about that a patisserie means deceptive reptile brontosaurus on the other hand means thunder reptile that's a better name but unfortunately we have to call it a pat a source i'll explain why then there's diplodocus that you've heard of diplodocus one of the long neck long tailed dinosaurs look sort of like an elephant in the middle and a snake on each end diplodocus means double beam it's a reference to the peculiar kind of vertebrae diplodocus had on it's tail vertebrae that may have actually helped it rear up then there's allosaurus allosaurus the meat eater the big meat eater of the jurassic allosaurus mean simply strange or other reptile you wouldn't think of was strange if you saw it you'd just think it was ferocious and you'd run the other way one of the ones i liked the best is called a narrow titan and arrow titan was a great big duck billed dinosaur of the cretaceous times and narrow titan means big duck and then there's the one i liked perhaps the best vol paki sevilla source so fun name to say kids love it paki several authorise translates to thick headed reptile this was the dinosaur that had inches and inches of solid bone and a tiny little brain velociraptor star of jurassic park raptor means thief the lhasa means swift this is the swift thief and the co-star of jurassic park tyrannosaurus rex the king of tyrant reptiles most dinosaurs are latinized in the masculine but a couple of m are latinized in the feminine and for good reason we're going to talk about a paleontologist named jack horner and jack horner has found an entire nesting ground of a dinosaur in montana he's found the nest he's found the eggs he's even found the babies appropriately enough he named mia sara not my us or us my mia sara that's feminine and it means good mother lizard the only other feminine name for a dinosaur i could find is lee ellen is sora you probably haven't heard of that one that's an australian dinosaur a pretty small one and it was named after a little girl named lee ellen rich whose parents tom and peter misha described the little ten inch dinosaur that's right if you find a dinosaur you get the name it and if you want to you can name it for your kid children have always thought of themselves as being have been empowered by knowing dinosaurs it's something they can learn and something they can know that their parents don't know but their parents try to teach him about dinosaurs and what assumptions do we make about these creatures,1
B01MUBPPKX,after breakfast he bought a second cup of coffee from the carafe pushed his plate away and reached for the stack of mail he drew from his pocket a small pearl handled pen knife and slit the flap of the large brown envelope he was disappointed to find that it contained a glossy invitation to a fundraising dinner it occurred to him that substantial funds would have to be raised to pay for the printing of the invitations he continued with the rest of the mail setting aside those letters that required an answer with only two letters remaining he opened the envelope that was to begin his political and personal ordeal the letter was printed with blue ink on a flimsy sheet of cheap typing paper the printing was so so uniform and symmetrical that it had to have been done with the aid of a ruler accompanying the letter was another smaller sheet of paper on which was a penciled diagram that appeared to be a floor plan scattered about the diagram where several exes in the same blue ink that was used to print the letter mayor dinner read the letter once quickly then again very slowly your honor i am the one that destroyed the more gel trust building and have the power to do more for many years while buildings were under construction or remodeling i planted explosives inside them and have been waiting for the right time i can destroy half the city and will if you don't follow my instructions that i will get to you soon if in three days you aren't ready to pay me one million dollars in cash another building will be destroyed and one will be destroyed every day until you do pay you can try to find some of the buildings that carry my seed of death and may might but you won't have enough time to find them all or even a few you have no choice but to pay but god help you if you don't jericho,0
B00DDU2O4Y,history we see history as an uninterrupted move towards modernity tour was progress this is the weak interpretation of history that tries to look to the past to find confirmation for depressant so that in a sense what we do is we built a teleology of history history us having a telus us we are the telos of history the end result of continuous progress but in the fourteenth and fifteenth century there was no concept of progress there was no idea of progress and indeed history is not this development open downed going nope but history is in a sense dialectic a move backwards and forwards this series of lectures which are entitle crises and renew old look at the contradictions of history at the shall we say fractures of history and the space between the fractures what we are going to do in this sixteen lectures is to look at western european society from thirteen hundred to fifteen hundred this is not a political narrative while we will not hear in this class is a continuous history about kings and wars and things like that rather what are we like to do is to approach this history both from below and from above it is the intertwining of popular history that is to say the history of peasants of minorities of the persecuted of women of witches and at the same time look at the history of high culture of the elite italian renaissance the making of a printing press the way in which this two things come together we like to think of the italian renaissance as one of those great landmarks in the development of western culture it happens had a western renaissance the italian renaissance and the north temporary france took place in the midst of extraordinary social economic intellectual cultural political crisis when youtube was being demolished by the plague in thirteen forty eight boccaccio is writing that they come around when dante is writing the divine comedy there are people dying of hunger throughout europe there are people who are probably even cannibalizing their own children or the children of others has done to rise this marvelous poem so in a sense where we are going to look is at the many different contradictions this is what is called the new social history the history from below which pays attention to the history of peasants and minorities and tries to fit them and to create in a sense a kind of a different meaning for history and meaning that comes from looking not at the great manned or of the great writers although we will look at them as well but to look at the structures and the way in which society is in a sense constructed can change by not individuals but by economic and social and cultural movements i know the purpose of this course is in a sense to see how the middle ages the late myths nature's fortune and created new forms of spirituality new systems of values new ways of conceiving a space of thinking of land or thinking of property or thinking of charity or thinking of women of in a sense constructing and creating new ideas about marriage and sexuality in a sense a kind of also attack against females and women's or minorities the creating of what is called perhaps incorrectly the creation of persecuting societies in the fourteenth and fifteenth century the course is organized into three different segments the first four lectures including this one attempts to set up the stage how did europe look in thirteen hundred what were his basic economic and social structures his political life what way are the boundaries of this world that we are going to explore the next four lectures lectures five to eight eight focus on the great crises that is to say on what we might consider the high points of the crises the famine of thirteen fifteen thirteen seventeen the war or there was that occurred between france and england and castille between thirteen thirty seven and fourteen fifty three three the so-called hundred years' war the plague the coming of the plague which swept through europe from thirteen forty eight one was on which returned every generation until the seventeenth century and finally the revolutions rebellions from below when disgruntled,1
B00BBJHWMI,when i first traveled to ireland to do some research i was amazed by the reaction of the people i talked to after i had explained what i was doing i was half expecting people to nod politely and then run off to watch paint dry because that would be more interesting than talking about irish history what i found instead was a country full of people who are passionate and excited about their history and wanted to talk and talk and talk about it every person had their own story this could be about a family member who had been involved in or witnessed a great moment in history or the story of the local area and the events that had unfolded there and these were great stories they weren't born ring facts recited without any humor or excitement but tales that brought the events of the past to life i quickly realized that in ireland unlike any other country i had ever visited history was alive and well and everyone seemed to own it and have their version of it true it wasn't always accurate and if the stories i heard are to be believed then the general post office in eastern nineteen sixteen was the busiest place in the world as everyone's grandfather uncle aunt and cousin seems to have been there in a way the accuracy of these tales doesn't really matter they show that everyone wants to be involved in the story of their country not everyone can be center-stage but we can twist the past a little bit to make sure that our relatives had at least a walk on role history in ireland is everywhere it's in people's heads it's in the architecture and the landscape it's on television and it's always causing rows and bars across the land in some parts of ireland history has been made into tourist attractions in new northern ireland historical conflicts are still being politically fought out and across the island history is being made every day one big question we've got to deal with from the outset is to define what we are dealing with in this audiobook what does ireland actually mean well this audiobook looks at ireland in several different weighs at one level this is simply about the history of the island of ireland all of us from milan head in the north to ms and head in the south but art and like any other country isn't an island where it clearly is an actual island but you know what i mean it's history isn't one of isolation as well as taking in the history of art and we will deal with all those external forces and countries that had an impact on irish history england and britain america france and so on we will also take a look at how ireland influenced the rest of the world and how in the twentieth century the two bits of ireland the irish republic and northern ireland got on with each other of course the big issues in history are contentious people worry whether or not history as it's told is true and whether or not the whole thing is biased one way or the other while my answers to those questions are simple first of all the truth what i've tried to do here is to tell the story as it happened and without bias rim member irish history is very contentious on both the nationalist and unionist communities have their own version of the past however there are lots of interesting things in history that weren't strictly true and have become part of the whole folklore and mystery of irish history we can't simply ignore these tales so they are included here but with an explanation as to the whole question of bias this is a tough one we all have our opinions and i'm sure you have yours make up your own mind as you go along and if you don't agree that's great history is made up of rows and fights so our disagreements just fit into a long and noble tradition,1

B00CH298M0,five million five hundred and eighty two thousand three hundred and twenty two these figures become doubly baffling when a further analysis reveals only forty six thousand two hundred fourteen of these masters owned fifty or more slaves entitling them to the aristocratic sounding term plantar way why did the vast majority of the white population unite behind these slaveholders in this fratricidal war why did they sacrifice over three hundred thousand of their sons to preserve an institution in which they apparently had no personal stake i have devoted much of my literary life to writing about the american revolution my exploration of our founding years convinced me of the originality and importance of the heritage created by the men and women who won an eight year struggle against the most powerful nation in the world and created the modern era's first republic ironically this conviction made me even more baffled by the civil war's eruption little more than a half century after george washington thomas jefferson and their compatriots turned the leadership of the new nation over to the next generation i never thought i would do more than muse about the civil war until my good friend byron holland said director of american historical publications and former publisher of two distinguished history magazines asked me to contribute a book entitled i wish i'd been there a gallery of well known historians was asked to insert themselves into famous events of the past and described them as if they were on the scene i became a spectator actor in john brown's eighteen fifty nine raid on harper's ferry i was mesmerized not only by the chief protagonist but by the reactions of prominent contemporaries ranging from robert e lee to abraham lincoln to ralph waldo emerson especially fascinating was the statement of the president of the united states in eighteen fifty nine james buchanan brown's reckless venture fire was caused buchanan said by an incurable disease in the public mind in his final message to congress in eighteen sixty as southern states seceded and civil war loomed he repeated the assertion buchanan's frequently hostile biographers have all dismissed or ignored these words they caught my attention because in two of my previous books i have explored how illusions play a role in history was the president talking about this sort of distortion few presidents have lower ratings than mister buchanan in the polls historians take to rank the nation's chief executives as great near great mediocre or failures on the other hand not many presidents had more experience in national politics than old buck he spent almost forty years as a congress admin and senator plus terms as secretary of state and ambassador to great britain before winning the white house i soon discovered that president buchanan did not originate the phrase public mind thomas jefferson frequently used the term to describe various aspects of the politics of his era writing to george washington and seventeen ninety two about the angry disagreements stirred by the new federal government's financial policy jeff morrison warned the public mind is no longer confident and serene abraham lincoln was another man who frequently invoked the phrase in eighteen sixty one he accused the south of the botching the public mind about the right to secede a century later democratic presidential candidate in adelaide stevenson declared those who corrupt the public mind are just as evil as those who steal from the public purse the public mind is ultimately linked with public opinion which one early nineteenth century commentator called that inexorable judge of men and manners in a republic but the public mind suggests something less fluctuating than opinion and more complex than an illusion which can be swiftly despair held by events the phrase implies fixed beliefs that are fundamental to the way people participate in the world of their time a disease in the public mind would seem to be a twisted interpretation of political or economic or spiritual realities that seizes control of thousands and even millions of mind americans first experienced one of these episodes in sixteen ninety two when the leaders of the massachusetts bay colony became convinced that witches were threatening their society with evil powers over two hundred people were arrested and flung into fetid jail,1
B002V5HAAA,twenty first century work change and more change note to all those who think the workplace is changing too fast fasten your seatbelts take a deep breath hang on every trend changing the american workplace is accelerating the b best methods for finding a job and prospering at work are also changing with these trends globalization and the roller coaster world economy the internet the speed at which companies are born and die changing employment laws and the new free agent phenomenon a few realities about the decline in job security fifty years ago the average tenure in a job was twenty three and a half years by nineteen ninety six that number had dropped to three and a half years if you're entering the workforce now at age twenty you're likely to have a job jobs by the time you're thirty two and as many as twenty jobs in your career the remaking restructuring resizing and consolidation of companies has steadily increased churn the coming and going of employees in nineteen hundred service industries employed thirty one percent of the american workforce manufacturing and agriculture combined employed sixty nine percent today that's reversed seventy eight percent of employed people work and services and twenty two percent in manufacturing and egg agriculture in two thousand and one to two thousand and two we lost more than two million manufacturing jobs many of them going to places like china and malaysia even as growth returns manufacturing is expected to grow just zero point three percent in employment per year the lowest increase among all industries big companies like general electric and i b m have stayed in the game by moving into service businesses like finance and consulting which displaced some workers but created opportunity for others companies have to compete ferociously to survive and thrive they have to change and keep costs down and that combination means your job may disappear because of forces beyond your control the phenomenon of companies exporting white collar and customer support jobs overseas is a recent example the new face of unemployment outplacement executive colin moore describes the shockwave that hit formerly secure employees recently there is something fundamental happening to america's workforce says colin in the last slowdown we saw an impact on job seekers across generations by two thousand and three you could walk into any outplacement firm and the first thing you'd notice was the number of white males over fifty strolling in the corridors we saw a whole generation of baby boomers who used to be the last standing getting whacked at all levels and in all fields what ha happens to all that talent ambition and drive for material well being everything now is uncertain and that puts an enormous amount of pressure on any individual to decide what their career path is going to be be prepared for multiple careers although traditional job security is under pressure layoffs are only half the story there's a revolution raging in the world of work and it isn't just about employers it's also about talent you and the increasing importance of people in our corporations big or small in fact btw there are irresistible trends working in favor of the employee in the next decade tens of millions of baby boomers will retire by twenty ten there will be a shortfall of as many as five million workers there simply aren't enough younger people entering the workforce to fill fill the gap tenure shortening will continue short job tenure means more people are moving from job to job even as the total unemployment rate stays low by historical standards some percentage of the workforce is always unemployed as people move from one job to another switching jobs he is no longer considered a negative ten years ago people who had three positions in ten years were labeled job hoppers people whose lack of loyalty made them untrustworthy now employers wonder if this person is so good why did they stay in one job for ten years,0

B00E9WC3GY,to fully understand the nature of submarine warfare and what sets it apart from the other aspects of war one needs to understand the nature of warfare itself it really isn't very difficult considered this analogy think of the world as a huge house let's say a a colonial i'm just sentimental that way each room is a country i am one country in the kitchen you're another country in the guest bedroom if i am going to wage war on you or you want to wage war on me we need to move from the kitchen to the guestroom or vice versa so we move into our respective positions and start taking shots at each other there's no huge surprise so we pretty much know the others coming we can hear the creaking floor we can see the enemy coming around the corner we fight and we go back to our respective rooms for the most part everything is out in the open this is how land battles naval surface battles and aerial warfare are conducted submarine warfare is nothing like that let's say i am preparing to go to war with you i have to sneak into your room when you're not looking then i have to follow you around constantly just out of your sight i constantly maneuver ducking bobbing sidestepping to stay behind you or out of your peripheral vision this can go on indefinitely then the order to go to war arrives i just reach out put a gun to the back of your head and blow your brains out i was already there the entire time you simply didn't know it or realize that soon enough now it doesn't go perfectly every time the enemy steps on the creaky bits of floor fairly often and when they do we catch them they explained that they were just looking around and sheepishly go away they'll try again later we step on the creaky board to just not nearly as often it also doesn't hurt that we have quieter shoes i think i've made my point when a submarine goes to it's dive point and submerges it is at war the analogy explains why if the war starts we need to be in position to pull the trigger and no one can know we were there that's what makes our submarines such a potent weapon the bad guys don't know where they are they are so when we hear that announcement over the one m c rig for patrol quiet it's game on in a very very serious way the preparations for that condition are very thorough first priority is to go through the entire boat checking stowage of all moveable items pots pans dishes tools locker doors and anything else that can move are secured then we do what's called angles and dangles the boat is put through a series of extreme maneuvers extreme down angles up angles and turns to port and starboard are repeated several times anything that can come loose is noted and taken care of one good thing about angles and dangles is a little known sport called deck plate surfing engine room lower level is laid out with a central aisle separating the port and starboard sides of the machinery these steel plates almost always have some degree gree of thin oil or grease residue on them if the proper shoes are worn and one has a good sense of balance they can slide down that aisle when the boat takes an extreme up or down angle grace or form doesn't matter it's all about distance when angles and dangles are through the announcement is made to place all watertight hatches on the latch a hatch has two positions it can be closed and dogged or open and on the latch a hatch is never allowed to remain free swinging the reason is very simple it weighs hundreds of pounds if the boat were to take a role either due to heavy seas or a sharp turn that hatch would swing if it slammed shut it would close with a tremendously loud bang if a crew member was passing through the hatch at the time any appendage in the way would instantly be broken something like a finger would be almost certainly severed completely,0

B0793BWZQ4,hammock has just told me are up in the mountains and having a sheep slaughtered in your honor i was prepared for nothing but a short walk and dinner with my extended family prior to our outing there was a slight change of plans her chemo was staying at home and marry him was to come with us instead also my suspicion that archaea i was on the move was confirmed by her joining our little group the bag of food including a dozen dan one yogurts mandarins bananas various second hand clothes and some other bits and pieces were divided between me marry him and fatma for us to carry the taxi that drove pastel boards took us to the furthest possible point on our journey leaving the rest of it for us to complete on foot whereas the house fatma pointed to the mountains in front of us making a walking gesture accompanied by a very specific a a noise which meant unequivocally a long walk ahead of us for about ten pointless minutes we waited for a donkey which was supposed to take grandma cared close to the mountains saving her energy for the more challenging parts of the journey but the transport did not come and we all had to start walking it was past midday the day was sunny and hot and a light breeze that stroking as gently wasn't spoiling us either at first duck here supporting herself with a stick was keeping a steady pace occasionally stopping to get a breather then the steeper it went the more exhausted she became taking breaks more often and extending the stopovers by lying down on the open soil she was incur credibly strong though i was watching her trekking along the rough path and could not believe my eyes her intensity force and stamina were not only inspiring but contagious and i still don't know how she did it and where the strength was coming from we kept climbing higher and higher but the peak started deceiving us and what at first looked like a fire five minutes walk turned into thirty minutes it was time to stop and get a proper rest with some snacks and water i was feeling dehydrated as foolishly for the first time i had not taken any water with me instead fatma offered me a sip aren't you thirsty i asked no i'm fine she responded they all seemed to me to be like camels capable of strolling long distances and yet feeling fine even grandma was taking tiny sips rinsing her mouth rather than drinking it it took us over one hour to get to the top which then surprised me by revealing nothing but a flat land a wild and infinite looking plateau with random tufts of greenery and scarce stones scattered around those fields and yet the uninhabited land was bringing to light some form of life indicated by several ploughed fields and odd houses seen from the distance is this the house i pointed at one on the horizon la la la i i i knew that sound in it's ambiguity very well the quietness and calmness of nature were only interrupted by grandma's panting and fatima's outrageous acts of vandalism shown towards nature without any thought or hesitation she threw away a plastic bottle filled with some water not only did she make me feel more dehydrated but also infuriated by the lack of appreciation and respect towards the environment this beautiful country has been turning into a rubbish bin because acts like this one have been copied by millions of other people who are disposing of rubbish anywhere besides what example was she given to young at raf my own lack of reaction disturbed me as much as this whole incident but there was no time for personal disputes as we had to get moving while walking through that upland i was pondering the way back home how will we going to be able to return before the dusk it was around two p m and there is not a sign of the house that we were to visit the vast stretch of land revealed another house seen through the lens of my camera with some people and two dogs standing outside it and observing us walking past pst the most surprising element of it all was the satellite dish it was not the first time that i saw a satellite dish attached to a house or it's ruins however here in the middle of nowhere it looked even more conspicuous proving a very sad fact to me that whatever standards of living they had to conform to the satellite dish was the most desirable commodity of all,0
B01H2H4V08,private first class martin w carlson a pennsylvanian stood guard at the entrance to the rear most second platoon pillbox as we approached he was a medic although medics were usually attached to rifle companies from a battalion medical detachment then carlson was a bonafide member of company i when the company had found itself short a medic once in france carlson who had had some medical training before being transferred to the infantry took over and was a medic from that time on they let anybody stand guard these days i joked as we reached the pillbox yes sir carlson smiled i figured might as well pull my turn my red crosses are inside we crouched to negotiate the low entrance to the pillbox the entrance was the fighting aperture from which the germans had defended the pillbox since all emplacements in the area were designed for defense to our rear our men defended the pillboxes by digging a series of foxholes around the perimeter a flickering light from a german canteen with a crude wick maintained a pallid smoke inside the pillbox and cast hesitant shadows on the walls the room was smaller than my cp but at a number of bunks and space for a table the men's faces were black from the crude lantern got the gasoline out of the td someone said lieutenant brock explained that they had moved into the pillbox only a few hours before my arrival and were enjoying it's relative comforts they would bring in a number of men at a time to get some sleep and during the daytime i leave only a skeleton force in the foxholes outside there seemed to be no fear that the germans would retake and reoccupied the emplacement as had beset the previous unit and caused it to fill in the entrance one of the squad leaders staff sergeant john a coup zeal of mckees rocks pennsylvania way was in the pillbox at the time of my visit along with lieutenant brok technical sergeant middlebrook and staff sergeant karl oram of lincoln nebraska the platoon guide brock and middlebrook accompanied us as we left the platoon cp and briefed us on the location of the three squads we he moved up the draw to the second pillbox were members of the squad commanded by staff sergeant sam jane mcgonigal of haskell oklahoma were digging shallow trenches to connect a defensive network of foxholes under a raincoat to protect it from the dampness stood a fifty caliber machine gun we got that off the td out there in the draw sergeant mechanical set got a lot of c rations and boku cigarettes thus far i had not noticed any of the bodies of either german or american soldiers in the two platoon areas we had visited brock said there was one goi to the right of his cp however and two germans fifty yards in front of mechanical squad i told him of battalions decision on removing the bodies but we decide need to wait until the next night when i could have a stretcher sent up with our supplies we visited the third squad commanded by sergeant robert j rouse of being hampton new york and prepared to move on to the first platoon moving back in the direction of the company cp to come upon the platoon from the rear ice saw the rear most pillbox which the platoon had thus far not occupied as we approached i could see the bodies of four americans and six germans draped in the very positions into which they had fallen and death they seemed to grope with lifeless arms for the protection of the pillbox my eyes were drawn irresistibly toward them but i forced myself to turn away we pushed through a hedgerow that ran parallel with the company front and came upon a group of men improving their foxholes they directed us to a pillbox a few yards to their right front where they said we could find lieutenant gaffigan the area here was even darker than surroundings for the tall tree shaded the faint glow of light which did successfully penetrate the clouds from the hidden moon long came out of the pillbox upon the call of the guard squeezing his way out of the entrance half blocked by a large slab of concrete that had evident only been blown where it was by some a feeble attempt to demolish the pillbox he was a tall straight virginian young with square cut features and spoke with a typical clipped virginia accent he showed us about the area calling the attention to the fact that there was a third pillbox fifty yards who is front which,1
B00D7LQD0A,one of the works that was widely read by them was montesquieu spirit of the laws in which montesquieu talks about the different kind of personality you have to develop depending upon the sort of regime under which people will live in a tyranny he says what you have to cultivate in the people as the capacity for fear in a monarchy you have to cultivate a taste and capacity for honor but in a republic he says what has to be cultivated more than anything else is virtue public virtue and they will be much said about virtue by the founders and by and by they and in the literature on which they depend for their arguments but it did take time slowly and then more quickly for people inured to the idea of honor and monarchy to metamorphose into a people committed to a life of virtue under a republican form of government and we can see this transition in the writings of the period and even in some of the people of the period i refer for example to author lee from the famous lee family in virginia here's lee writing in in seventeen sixty nine this is just two years before the revolution will break out and he says liberty is the fairy idol of my soul the parent of virtue the nurse of heroes the dispenser of general happiness because slavery is the monstrous mother of every abominable vice and every atrocious il now this sounds very much like a an enthusiastic colonial resident who's going to be taking out against a sea of troubles in in great britain actually here's a graduate of eton who has studied medicine at edinburgh he's studied law in london he's he he is of course a a faithful subject of the crown but more than that he is a great lover and defender of liberty by seventeen seventy six the same author lee will be a member of the committee of secret correspondence attempting to raise funds in france and elsewhere in europe for the american cause and arguing that europe should support this cause because the principles are universal so in the years before the revolution even amidst strenuous protests and boycotts aroused by by britain's tax policies we see that american resistance is is one of restraint it's it's it's almost a kind of alternating ham lesean sort of thing nobody really wants to break from the mother country nobody wants to continue very few want to continue to live under the conditions that the tax policies especially had established now this notion that what was going on in the colonies was something for the entire world and not just for the colonists was expressed by many of the founders in fact years later after the revolution was successful after the government was was in place and functioning and eighteen eighteen the ex president john adams writing a letter to niles says the american revolution was not a common event it's effects and consequences have already been awful over a great part of the globe and when and where are they to cease what do we mean by the american revolution do we mean the american war the revolution was effected before the war commenced the revolution was in the minds and hearts of the people a change in their religious sentiments of their duties and obligations adams recognizes that what was develop ped in the colonies by way of argument what was won through a revolutionary war was a commitment to a set of principles that were universal in their reach and in their appeal because they were grounded in the very nature of things now of course it's a commonplace to understand that the revolution was primarily due to instigated by tax policies and so forth and i think when youngsters are educated in the american schools depends on what part of the world you're living in how some of these events are treated but we do hear about the brutal tax policies the imposition and the the tyrannical steps taken by parliament and i will get to some of those matters but let's do understand that that they have war views on the other side and views carrying great weight britain france and spain had been engaged in warfare battles skirmishes large and small at least since sixteen eighty nine and culminating finally in seventeen sixty three at the end of the seven years' war all of this having to do with who would have control of the colonies but early on particularly the the very lucrative fur trade in the colonies britain to defend the colonists and to secure the colonies and their own commercial affairs had committed sips,1
B00KI1YQ5Q,on palm sunday april nine eighteen sixty five ulysses s grant general and chief of the union army met robert e lee his confederate counterpart in the modest parlor of wilmer mclean in the southside virginia village of appomattox court house lee was the very picture of dignity wearing a solemn expression and fine dress uniform he embodied the proud gentility of the south's planter elite grant dressed casually in a mud spattered uniform embodied the dignity of an altogether different sort that of the hardscrabble farmers and wage earners he had molded into a f formidable fighting machine after awkwardly exchanging some pleasantries about their service in the mexican war the two men agreed to the surrender terms that effectively ended the civil war in essence grants terms set free the conquered soldiers of the army of northern virginia on the promise that they would never again take up arms and against the united states grants magnanimity in this hour and lee's stoic resignation in defeat inaugurated a process of national healing that would not only restore the shattered union but would also prepare the way for america's emergence as a world power this scene forms one of the most significant moments in the story americans tell themselves about the meaning and legacy of the civil war unfortunately it is a myth grant and lee did meet at appomattox and sign the surrender terms and mclean's parlor but the meaning of this event has never been fully understood as grant and lee set their hands to the surrender terms they positioned themselves at the center of a bitter and protracted contest over what exactly was decided that april day at appomattox the two men represented competing visions of the peace for grant the union victory was one of right over wrong huh he believed that his magnanimity no less than his victory vindicated free society and the union's way of war grant's eyes were on the future the future in which southerners chastened and repentant would join their northern brethren in the march towards moral and material progress lie by contrast believed that the union victory was one of might over right in his view southerners had nothing to repent of and had survived the war with their honor and principles intact he was intent on restoration on turning the clock back as much as possible to the days when virginia led the ne nation and before sectional extremism alienated the north from south each man believed that he alone held the moral high ground each man hoped to win over the reasonable men among his former enemies and each hoped perhaps naively that the other would be his first convert in peace as in war the two men also represented different strategic styles lee's challenge once again was to make the best of a weak hand in this he would do in the surrenders aftermath with characteristic creativity and audacity understanding all along that his personal prestige was the grey latest asset that the advocates of restoration possessed grand by contrast played the long game a man whose generalship at times relied on power and persistence rather than a maneuver grant doggedly pressed the case that appomattox signified a union transformed better than before and improved ng still these competing visions and strategies would exert a profound influence over postwar politics white union soldiers northern civilians and the republican and war democrat camps and anti confederate southerners rallied around the idea of the surrender as vindication they saw the unions mercy exemplar fine by lincoln and grant as a source of moral authority and as the best means to knit the country back together free blacks and former slaves both soldiers and civilians joined together with white abolitionists and with some radical southern unionists in staking out the argument as a variation on the theme of vindication that the war had struck a blow for human equality the union's magnanimity was in their view a means to secure the goals of black citizenship and of racial harmony they too claimed lincoln and grant as the heroes who proved that victory favoured the righteous but these victor's interpretations of apa maddox were fiercely contested from the start southerners who had supported the confederacy together with northern anti war copperhead democrats who had deplored the lincoln administration's policies particularly emancipation rallied around the theme of restoration,1
B00DI952QC,some vehicles for their expression came about and when we talk about europe we're talking about then more than a place we're not talking about a continent even a large continent that stretches from asia to the atlantic from the north sea down to the mediterranean we're talking about a set of memories it's part of the western diet dna moreover we see that the political social economic cultural history of europeans has affected almost every aspect of the world civilization and it's done so through a variety of means the obvious and most immediate especially for those of us living in north america are the emigrations of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries in particular but the contact that began at the end of the fifteenth it was through contact conversion and immigration that so many of the ideas and institutions of europe reached around the world and this contact and this emigration brought ideas and memories that then took root in a different soil and allow the opportunity of other places to benefit from european experience in some instances to reject them completely and others to develop and to mature them moreover europe is a place that created and wrote and spread and extended ideas europe is a continent of ideas europeans are always discussing principles and how those principles should best be made manifest as a result the books that have animated western civilization have spread and some of the ideas in those books have taken root very very deeply when we think of communist china for example we must remember that communism is a european invention and is now the dynamic force that helped create the modern chinese state when we think of liberalism and democracy we think of those principles that have animated so much of the free world consequently europe is a dynamic it's a dynamic because it is driven by an energy of it's own creation and also by an energy that can be applied at different times in different places because it was debate it was argument over these fundamental principles that drove so many of the international relations and drove so many of those peoples around the world to either embrace or to reject things that happened in europe so european civilization put down deep roots and the end institutions where these flourished still live with us today and still to some extent define what it is to be a citizen of the planet earth so when we talk about institutions like parliamentary or representative democracy we're talking about a set of principles that developed on the european continent in it's earliest forms in the palace of ancient greece nice but also that then developed through the british parliamentary system and then through the nineteenth century manifestations of liberal elements of representational government to the creation of the concepts that really drive us in any free society the rule of law an independent judiciary and those key concepts that put the law above everybody including the ruler of the state only in a free society can there be a law that pertains to everyone regardless of power wealth or influence and that again is one of the great gifts of europe to the world social legislation the sorts of ideas that are particularly european and the instruments in the vehicles that were developed in order to put them in place and to give them a structure are particularly european the idea then that the community owes much to the individual and that the individual owes much to the community is something that is profound and based upon the experience of europe over a number of centuries we will see in subsequent lectures how these ideas took deep root beginning almost in those earliest years of european civilization we'll see in fact how after the collapse of rome the idea of communal agriculture through feudalism the idea of a memorial economy created a sense of community in which there were mutual responsibilities for the economy and society to work there was a set of responsibilities that were both enshrined in law and then practice and customs this in fact is very much still part of the european imagination the idea of this mutual responsibility and this mutual dynamic between the individual and the larger group the collective the state the community however you want to define them and so many of the ideologies than that will be discussing later in this course really try and deal with this issue what are the restrictions on the concept of individual human rights that allow the community to function and then what are the necessary restrictions on the community to allow individual freedom to operate these are the sorts of dynamics and challenges and debates that still exists that still animate european political discussion and as a consequence help animate ours as well because these are not site specific depending on a continent,1
B00DGCI2JU,or in the night when she'd cried i'd urge you if you yelled miss said the nurse stiffly and i slept quiet last night but she knew it was her mother had to have been her mother she remembered the sweet smell of her perfume and no one but her mother ever wore that cent her perfume smelt of flowers but have no flowers the little girl ever found neither in the dozens of overflowing vases set nearly every room of their tall magnificent townhouse nearly every day of the year nor anywhere in the long scrolling curves of the flowerbeds in the gardens behind the house nor in the straight to meticulous rows within the glass houses and orangeries behind the guard then she once confided to a new nurse her wish to find the flower that had produced her mother's scent she was inspired to do so when the nurse introduced herself by saying hello little one your daddy has told me your name but you know mine eats pansy just like the flower i bet you have lots of pansies in your garden yes we do replied the little girl politely and they're my favorite almost my favorite is a flower i don't know it is the flower that my mother's scent comes from i keep hoping i will find it perhaps you will help me pansy had laughed at her but it was a friendly love what a funny little thing you are she said patsy at your rage wanting to know about perfume you'll will be a heartbreaker in a few years i guess the little girl had looked at her new nurse solemnly but hadn't troubled to explain further she could tell pansy meant to be kind it was true that she had first become interested in gardens of something other than merely places her nurses sometimes took her in the peremptory way of grownups when she'd made the connection between perfume smells and flower smells but she'd very soon discovered that she simply liked gardens her mother's world her mother's house was very exciting but he was also rather scary she liked plants they were quiet and they stayed in the same place but they weren't boring like a lot of the things she was supposed to be interested in were boring such as doles which just lay there unless you pick them up and did things with them and then the chief thing you were supposed to do with them apparently was to change their clothes and could there be anything more awfully deadly boring than changing any one's clothes any more often than one was utterly obliged to plants got on with making stems and leaves and flowers and fruit whatever you did and a lot of them were nice to the touch slight attractive fairness of rabbits ears and cupid's darts the slick waxy surfaces of camellia leaves and ivy and lots of them had beautiful flowers which changed both shape and color as they opened and some of them smelled interesting even if none of them smelt like her mother's perfume and then there were things like apples and grapes which were the best things in the world when you could break them off from the stem yourself and eat them right there from a nurses point of view the youngest girl was the least trouble of the three she neither went out seeking mischief the more perilous the better the way the eldest did nor answered in pertinently and with a vocabulary alarmingly beyond her age the way the second did her one consistent misbehavior tiresome enough indeed as it was and which no amount of punishment seemed able to break her of was that of escaping into the garden the moment the nurses i was diverted where she would later be found digging little holes and planting things discarded toys especially dolls her half eaten biscuits dead leaves and dry twigs singing to herself and covering her white pinafore and stockings with dirt none of the nurses ever noticed that the twigs where they left where she planted them against all probability grew one old gardener noticed and because he was old and considered rather silly he had,0

B00GAYPQ40,benjamin franklin did not live to see the first full decade of american sovereignty yet he proved the central transformational figure in a transformative period of the nation's history born in seventeen o six into modest circumstances in boston then a mere outpost of fewer than nine thousand residents franklin kept his public career eight decades later in the glittering capital of paris where he ushered the newly independent america onto the world stage he died in seventeen ninety not long after the ratification of the federal constitution a document he endorsed albeit with a certain ironic detachment along the way franklin's ideas actions and achievements in short his own lived experience helped set america on course for it's steady journey from colonial backwater to world power it is no wonder then that at the age of seventy eight franklin saw himself supremely qualified to spell out the essence of the young republic leavened with his own hopes and aspirations for those beyond the chores in the few short months after victory over the british sealed by the treaty of paris on september third seventeen eighty three franklin the best known american of his day had found himself besieged by potential immigrants eager to learn more about this new society and perhaps to profit from it his response was simple and direct newcomers must rely on their skills or a commitment to hard honest work he explained in the published essay information to those who would remove to america for it was surely ill advised for high born europeans to arrive on american soil in the hopes of simply trading on their breeding or conventional social standing in europe it has indeed it's value but it is a commodity that cannot be carried to a worse market than to that of america where people do not inquire concerning a stranger what is he but what does he do franklin wrote in march seventeen eighty four if he has any useful art he is welcome and if he exercises it and behaves well he will be respected by all that know him but a mere man of quality will be despised and disregarded according to these opinions of the americans one of them would think himself more obliged to a genealogist who could prove for him that his ancestors and relations for ten generations had been plowman smiths carpenters turners weavers tanners or even shoemakers and consequently that they were are useful members of society here franklin gives a concrete american voice to one of the most cherished notions of the age of enlightenment that the value of learning and knowledge of information and data is directly proportional to it's practical import or utility in other words to be of any real value knowledge jj has to be truly useful it cannot rest on blind acceptance of past tradition or rely on sanctification by entrenched authority after an adolescent detour into what he later dismissed as dangerous metaphysical reasonings franklin enthusiastically adopted this notion of useful knowledge as his lifelong intellectual social and political standard and he worked tirelessly to inculcate these values in the new americans society that was beginning to take shape all around him,1

B01COQXZ4A,the editor of caravan and trailer was a man named stuart mcrae then aviation engineer by training who had fallen into the world of journalism by accident rather than design he was intrigued by the pictures of clark's outlandish creation and decided to pay a visit to bedford taking the day off work in order to meet him his first impression was one of disappointment clark was there a very large man with rather hesitant speech who had first struck me as being amiable but not outstandingly bright he was soon forced to revise his opinion clark had an expanding brain that functioned like an accordion he sucked in ideas mix them together and then expelled them as something altogether more melodious where most people saw problems he saw only solutions koch opened up the yard behind the house in order to show mcrae his latest brainchild it was huge far bigger than it looked in the pictures and streamlined into the bargain mccray was stunned he felt as if he were looking at something from the future clark proposed a spin round the bedfordshire countryside with himself at the wheel and his guest in the caravan mcrae made himself comfortable on the don la pillow cushions and got happily sloshed on the various bottles in the well-stocked bar and as there were no breathalyzers in those days nor any stigma attached to drink driving he was able to drive back to london without fear of being caught by the police when he was back at work the following morning somewhat sore of head he wrote a fulsome article about clarke's extraordinary prototype and there the story might have ended for stuart macrae quit his job at caravan and trailer soon afterwards and took up a position as editor of armchair science but one morning in the spring of nineteen thirty nine mcrae secretary answered the phone to a most mysterious caller there's a jeffery somebody on the phone she called across the office he was calling on a matter of some urgency mcrae took the call and found himself speaking to someone called not jeffrey but millis jeffress jeffress said that he was keen to find out more about one of the items featured in the latest issue of armchair science you have an article about a new and exceptionally powerful magnet i want full information about this magnet right away please mcrae was taken aback by the call his gruff manner and asked to know more it is a bit awkward admitted jeffress that i am not at liberty at present to tell you what this is about he suggested that they meet for lunch and talk it over in private forty eight hours later mcrae found himself in the art theatre club seated opposite one of the most extraordinary individuals he had ever met melissa jeffress had a leathery looking face and barrel like torso and arms that reach nearly to the floor to my crazed discerning eyes he looked like a gorilla but when the gorilla opened his mouth it was at once obvious that he had a brain like lightning jeffress explained that he worked for a highly secret branch of the war office one that specialized in intelligence and research with international tensions on the rise he had been tasked with devising unconventional weaponry that might be needed in the near future his interest in magnets stemmed from a revolutionary underwater mine that he was trying to develop it's explosive charge was coated in magnets and equipped with a time delay detonator the idea was that it would stick to the side of a ship when placed there by a diver and go bang in due course and sink the said ship the need for such a weapon was real and urgent less than six months earlier in the winter of nineteen thirty eight hitler had launched his plan zed the immediate and dramatic strengthening of the german kriegsmarine the plan envisaged the construction of eight aircraft carriers twenty six battleships and more than forty crew oozes as well as two hundred and fifty u-boats britain was in no position to compete in such a naval arms race and was faced with having to find a more creative way to redress the balance senior figures in the war office and admiralty decided that sinking german ships will be more cost effective than building british ones but jeffress faced an insurmountable problem he was unable to find magnets that would function underwater and was also too busy to build a reliable time delay detonator without one he knew that his half built magnetic mine wouldn't work after a well lubricated lunch finished off with goblets of brandy mcrae,1

B005VT4NBW,to teach us the boundaries of the states my seventh grade geography teacher would hold up cut outs and we will raise our hands vying for the chance to identify which state had the corresponding shape how we distinguished wyoming from colorado both rectangles eludes me these many years later maybe she just didn't include them after all how much value is there in knowing which rectangle is wyoming and which is colorado later in life i came to realize that there is value in learning about the borders of colorado and wyoming but that value resides not in knowing what their shape is but in knowing why it is why for example are the straight lines that defined wyoming located where they are and not say ten miles farther north or west far more knowledge results from exploring why a set of conditions exists than from simply accepting those conditions and committing them to memory asking why a state has the borders it does unlocks a history of human struggles far more history than this book can contain though this book does aspire to unearth the keys consider for a moment the cluster of states composed of maine new hampshire and vermont why don't those states extend to their natural boundaries the st lawrence river and the atlantic ocean how come canada got that land why does delaware have a semicircle for it's northern border what's at its center and why was it encircled why does texas have that square part poking up and why does the square part just miss connecting with kansas leaving that little oklahoma panhandle in between the more one looks at state borders the more questions those borders generate wider the carolinas and dakotas have a north state and a south state couldn't they get along why is there a west virginia but not an east virginia and why does michigan have a chunk of land that so obviously part of wisconsin it's not even connected to the rest of michigan this book will provide those answers state by state along with the district of columbia the events that resulted in the location of each state's present borders will be identified a state border is both an official entrance and a hidden entrance the official entrance is the legal threshold to estate but it's hidden entrance beckons us to the past here at the state line we can come in contact with struggles long forgotten and now overgrown by signs saying things like like welcome to kansas please drive carefully,1

B01F2BZ3OY,cultural heritage and social organization immigrated and settled in each ecologically specific region of the subcontinent over subsequent centuries the developments of their economy diet and general ways of life have been shaped by that region's distinct physical environment including natural factors like the amount of rainfall the flow of rivers effects of mountain ranges and location on the coast or inland one result has been dozens of different languages each region developing and so having one or more of its own and also having many localized distinct dialects some single provinces within india today for example have the same population as today's brazil germany or italy pakistan and bangladesh each individually has more people than russia or japan so while outsiders may think of the indian subcontinent as one place in fact it has rarely ever been united under a single ruler it contains dozens of distinct languages some like hindi with hundreds of millions of speakers some endangered ones with only a handful of speakers remaining the best way to understand the present condition of india pakistan and bangladesh is to follow their development from the origins of humans in the sub continent through their long history up to the present today the people of south asia total twenty percent of the entire world's population they individually and collectively have a rich array of achievements but they also face vital challenges over these lectures we will explore the reasons that this major part of humanity has developed in its one distinctive ways over long historical time now my own engagement with india began when i was still in college and had the opportunity in nineteen seventy seventy one to live and study as an undergraduate in india with a brief visit to pakistan both india and pakistan were new nations less than twenty five years old about my own age the last bloody war between those two nations had only happened six years earlier indeed during my first stay indian pakistan went to war yet again the country that was west and east pakistan split with east pakistan breaking away to become the new nation of bangladesh as air raid warnings sounded i remember that the major city of bombay also mumbai was completely blacked out at night the famous taj mahal had burlap sacks covering it's dome so that the moonlight usually such a lovely illumination would not alert fear of pakistani warplanes about where to drop their bombs fortunately neither india nor pakistan yet had nuclear weapons although these would come soon enough but many thousands of soldiers and perhaps up to three million civilians died in that war before bangladesh was born these dramatic changes even within my own lifetime are characteristic of the dynamic changes found throughout the long history of the subcontinent since that first visit i frequently lived studied and taught in india for extended periods with more briefly doing so in bangladesh as well over those four decades i have been publishing books and articles teaching and speaking about the history of the people and cultures of this complex and fascinating region of the world in particular many of my books have looked at for centuries of interactions between the people from south asia and the people from the west as they occurred both in india and also as men and women from india emigrated to europe i have never ceased to be fascinated by all but i continue to learn about indian history i trust you will find it as exciting and edifying as i do in our journey through indian history we are able to draw upon a great variety of historical evidence produced by and about indians over these fifty centuries much of this evidence comes from the physical objects that indians have produced including artifacts works of art and buildings some of these date back to five thousand years ago many of india's cultures also developed rich bodies of literature initially passed down orally but then written in clay in sewn inscriptions and then on palm leaves these enable us to understand how the people at that time understood themselves and the people in the world,1
B01HSELRNE,the kings and queens of england have always punched above their weight they started out fighting for control of the southeast corner of england but it was not too long before they had taken over the remainder of the british isles finally they won the right to dominate a large proportion of the world at the height of the british empire the nation's monarchs ruled over a quarter of the world's population and made their presence felt in many other parts of the globe they have also made a great contribution to the establishment of common law which forms the basis of the legal systems of the united states australia and india as well as many other countries and the magna carta signed by king john in june twelve fifteen guarantees freedoms that a cherished by much of the world britain's title to north america was created with the support of henry the seventh rained fourteen eighty five to fifty no nine and the first english colonies were established under elizabeth the first rained fifteen fifty eight to sixty no three although the american colonies were lost during the reign of georgia the third reigned seventeen sixty two eighteen twenty the british empire continued to expand in india africa and the far east east it reached its zenith during the long reign of queen victoria reigned eighteen thirty eight to nineteen o one whose upright family values perhaps shielded the british monarchy from the upheavals that toppled most other european dynasties other english monarchs such as charles the second the merry monarch reigned sixteen sixty to eighty five were not so virtuous although his excesses were forgiven in the general relief that followed ten years of dour puritan rule his father charles the first rained sixth eighteen twenty five forty nine had been much less popular with the english people but the fate of the latter extended the liberties of the british by establishing the presidents of the house of commons the reign of james second reign sixteen eighty five to eighty eight also came to an abrupt end end but once again the british people were the beneficiaries for the nation gained its bill of rights even in this less than deferential age the respected figure of elizabeth the second has ensured that the monarchy still flourishes although it is no longer the political center of national life the roots of monarchy england has been ruled by some sixty six kings and queens over a period of around one thousand two hundred years their reigns can be divided into ten dynasties outlined in the chapters of this book with the troubled reins of the houses of lancaster and york combined into one chapter the anglers saxon egbert of wessex who ruled from eight o two was perhaps the first true english king but legend has it that england had an earlier monarch king arthur arthur story gained substance within the pages of history a region britannia a history of britain writ one by geoffrey of monmouth between eleven thirty five and eleven thirty nine according to earlier chroniclers arthur led the welsh who arrived from the continent in the bronze age against the west saxons who were advancing westward from the thames in the sixth century a d this suggests that he was welsh not english others maintain that arthur was not a king but a professional soldier who commanded a cavalry force trained along roman lines what we do know is that shortly after the romans relinquish control of britain in a d four ten a tyrant named water gun seized power instead of attacking call in an attempt to turn himself into a roman emperor like earlier usurpers had done he was content to stay in britain he gained allies by granting land to the saxon people in kent who ooh then aided him in his struggles against the pics and the scots who lived beyond hadrian's wall however the saxons finally turned against him which drove him to face them in battle the two sides fought four battles in all but vulcans army was severely weakened after the final confer licht in which he lost his son vulcan was forced to give the invaders even more land this time in sussex and essex,1
B07BZV7FKK,ten years ago i was facing one of the hardest periods of my life i could barely do the simple things and the worst part of my day just trying to get out of bed as soon as my alarm went off i would lie there and think about everything i needed to do my mind started filling with excuses and next thing you know i'm hitting the snooze button one night after for a few too many manhattans i had this epiphany there was a distinct gap between the alarm going off and my reaction to it and i thought hmm mal i wonder maybe if you move fast enough maybe you can close that gap instead of hitting the snooze alarm maybe i could just launch out of bed bed while the very next morning the alarm rang and that's exactly what i did five four three two one boom i launched myself right out of bed it not only worked but that's also how by accident i created the most powerful mind trick on the planet i call it the five second rule it's simple and there's so much science to back it up now using the five second rule and the five four three two one countdown method i learned how to change my decisions my mindset my habits and day by day my entire life changed i first shared the rule in a tedx talk and fourteen million views later i decided i'd better write a book about this well it got published last year it became why one of the most read books in the world and it's now been translated into thirty one languages and yep you can find it right here on audible the response was so incredible that i now reach twenty million people a month on social media and every single day people around the world post their five second rule stories and ask for more advice about how to change their lives for the better and that my friend is how kick ass with mel robbins was born it was born thanks to you,0
B00KI0AT5S,i thought i was going to wake up in jason's arms but i didn't although i did wake up with a horrible headache because of all the crying i had done the night before stretching and getting up from bed i walked over to my makeup bag and searched for some type of tylenol or advil to relieve my headache stumbling upon my makeup removal wipes my tummy automatically started doing summer assault and flips because of the memories of jason last night at first i thought it was all a dream and i never wanted to wake up from it it made me think that the horrible mess prior was so worth it because we came out to a beautiful thing afterwards watching him as he wiped away the smeared mascara on my face i could tell there was something in him that was changing although i could tell there was a part of him that wanted to fight it every step of the way somehow some way i was going to get through that barrier i noticed it in his eyes when he was wiping away the mascara he was biting his lower lip and scrunching his eyebrows together and kept shaking his head back i started to wonder if everything jade had told me was only a small portion of what growing up in the williams household was like i started to think back on the years at school and realized that not once did mr or mrs williams ever visit their children meanwhile my dad was always making surprise appearances sometimes i was kind of annoyed with it because on some occasions i was rather hung over but i was grateful my dad was always there for me jade and i were so close that my dad always included jade and jason in on whatever we were doing sometimes we would just go get something to eat or even go see a movie i thought it was really sweet when the school sent home gift basket order forms around midterm and finals time miraculously jade and jason always received one but it was never from their parents i knew they were from my dad but he never told me about it i also started to question if i was strong enough to help jason with his struggles i just didn't want to create a bigger mess for jason to have to deal with and clean up i wanted to help him not hurt him taking some tylenol and a few sips of water i started to get ready our flight back home would be leaving shortly i wondered where jason was but maybe he just needed this time alone to think about things between us and where exactly we went from here like i was after taking my shower i just put on some jean shorts and a sweatshirt i didn't bother washing my hair because i didn't feel like it today was my lazy day and i was welcoming it with open arms,0
B00GISN9TM,the tenth corps had already secured the title of an area hill five twenty two paulo and the son when he goes straight all of which allowed the americans access to the northern entrance of lady valley the final objective was to secure corridor garibay halting the increasing japanese amphibious reinforcement of the lady garrison this would also put the tent corps in a position to continue south through autumn the valley and secure the other vital port at autumn ok in order to achieve these goals the corps directed a two pronged attack into lady valley each led by one of its divisions general krueger had expected the japanese to strongly defend taliban with it's airfields and therefore expected the first cavalry division to face the bulk of the resistance however the japanese had not acted as expected and the twenty fourth infantry division faced the most severe resistance upon landing on lady as a result general krueger moved some of the cavalry battalions to the twenty fourth infantry sector to aid them in clearing there is one after the capture of paulo and hills b and c the twenty fourth infantry division was to attack west while the first cavalry division protected it's northern flank because the twenty fourth infantry division had not received its third regiment back from the pawn on straight assignment the first cavalry brigade was to rely leave all of its combat troops assigned to rear area or security duties to allow the full weight of the twenty fourth infantry to be available for the renewed drive west the attack would be made along highway two or one lane all weather road which was twelve feet wide and made of crushed rock and gravel lieutenant generals or saku suzuki commanding the thirty fifth army had originally planned that once the americans had reached the entrances to laity valley he would withdraw his troops along with sufficient supplies for six months to the hills overlooking the valley but the swift advance of the americans had made this plan impossible to carry out instead he directed his troops to assemble in the vicinity of jato at the southern edge of the laity valley here he ordered the forty first infantry regiment of the thirtieth infantry division and the one hundred and sixty ninth independent infantry battalion from the one hundred and second infantry division to prepare to stop the advancing americans soon after the seventeenth independent infantry battalion also of the one hundred and second infantry division was ordered to join them these units were all new to laity having arrived through carragher a bay by sea since the americans landed on the island for when the japanese had changed their plans to make laity the decisive land battle they had moved swiftly within days of the american landings the commander of the southwest area fleet vice admiral junichi amiga ordered reinforcements to eighty two nights later october twenty fifth the first two thousand five hundred and fifty japanese reinforcements of the forty first infantry regiment landed at one mark transported on high speed naval transports from it an owl on their return american naval planes flying off escort carriers protecting the laity beachheads sank to escorting warships and one of the transports which delayed two more regiments awaiting transport nevertheless over the next four days four more infantry battalions arrived at omak sent by the thirty fifth army into actually these moves confused the american commanders with some believing that the japanese were withdrawing from laity instead of reinforcing it radio intelligence and gorilla reports soon cleared up the confusion as they reported additional reinforcements landing not departing,1

B00DNB8ZWI,see if this sounds familiar a senior vice president svp in a small corporation called me for some help her division had just reorganized and one of the units in it had been newly created to help with some issues that had plagued the division for years while this new unit was trying to get it's focus and it's vision there was increasing conflict in the whole division the reorganization had pulled some people off of the work they had been doing and everyone was feeling pinched and irritable the svp noticed that conflict was springing up all over and that the lines of communication one which had never been stellar were disintegrating she worried that unless they began to really understand one another and learn how to deal with their disagreements new silos would spring up that were worse than the ones the reorganization was designed to dismantle she thought some kind of retreat would be g just what the group needed including a few days of the basics listening skills myers-briggs and so forth to get into a better space with each other we decided on a joint focus of on the one hand trying to understand and make sense of this new structure now that it was in place and on the other hand building skills around listening to one another and dealing well with the inevitable conflict we picked a date the client found a venue and i bought airplane tickets the first day of the retreat was fantastic the group was much less divided than i had feared and they were eager to learn new skills and tools it wasn't until the end of the first day that i picked up on the murmurs about two of the members of the group both in the newly organized unit by the end of the morning session on the second day i had begun to pay attention to those two fellows and it was clear that they hated one another in clipped polite in front of the outsider tones they interacted tersely each of them looking like he might swat at the other given any provocation how had i missed this on day one because i thought the problem was between units inside this division not inside a single unit i had designed the first day to mix the units up this was a team building retreat after all it was only as we began to unpack strategy that the units got together and i saw what the svp had seen now the level of anxiety in the room was high other groups of people were warily watching the two at the heart of the conflict and the easy banter of the day before was gone i took my client outside the meeting room at a break time and asked her to describe these two guys they hate each other she said that's another thing that's going on here,0
B07N9ZXDL3,mr blue sky let's get a few things straight as the kids say yo what's up you know that's why being a kid is such a relatively short portion of an average length human life they see you do a lot of lovable dumb stuff yet with a little maturity and good luck and a reasonable dental plan they can emerge from their youth relatively unscathed to get on with the business of being f fully realized adults that can sometimes be a lot tougher than being young especially when you factor in such inscrutable things as careers an overactive bladders but adulthood is also where you realize your greatest potential generally speaking show me someone who topped out in childhood and i'll show you someone who gets laughed at by everybody else lse at the high school reunion so then let's talk about these things in the context of miss middlebury and mister travis who seemed to be following in highly different trajectories after the new year's eve tongue wrestling session i'm not one for too much exposition but as someone who's been watching these two a lot longer than you have i can offer a bit of context about jojo middlebury i'll say this she's come by her wariness honestly if not entirely innocently what i mean is she entered this world with a crappy set of cards this happens and i don't want to hear one word about a master plan because you do not have the time for me to dissect and dispel the many layers of that notion anyway she's come far from her beginnings even if the journey has been more of a squiggle than a straight line as the song goes regrets she's had a few but she's a good human as humans go when it comes to though she cares about she she's loyal to the core she's also got a good work ethic and she makes a mean eggplant parmesan and young mr travers there has also come by his worldview in an organic way good parents who instilled their morals and values in him and then encouraged him to question them and redefine his own good if isolated upbringing that tends to be the case with only children he has a mind and is used it and for the most part he's kept it open he cares deeply about the people in his life be they transient or permanent keeps in touch with former students causes appearance likes cats he's may be more idealistic than most people of his age and experience and that can be seen in some quarters as weakness i don't think he's weak i think he's a man in progress and linus like jojo is a good human would that they all were a long time ago in your concept of time but nothing more than a fraction of a second in mind there was a fellow named johann wolfgang von gupta a writer of some renown he committed something to paper but i like to recite because it gets close to the universal truth whatever you can do or dream you can do begin it boldness has genius power and magic in it i dare say that youngster travis is embracing that ethos it'll be interesting to see what comes of it because jojo middlebury isn't by buying boldness or much of anything else not yet anyway maybe not ever,0

B01N1STJI8,the land is a great way to understand region's history culture and beliefs first is the gangetic plain located in north india it's one of the most fertile regions of the indian subcontinent it takes it's name from the ganges river also known as the ganga which descends from the himalayan mountains it is one of the most fertile regions of india in terms of harvest and crop yields moving eastward were brought to the bay of bengal and the bengal regions with it's vast network of marsh waterways it's long been a center of maritime commerce and exchange with strong links to southeast asia and indeed the broader commercial maritime world it's perhaps no surprise that this was the first row region of india to fall to british rule let's now move to the south to the deccan plateau this plateau covers the southern torso of the indian sub continent though verdant in some regions it is mostly dry and harsh it's mountains and river ways have actually historically prevented outsiders from fully militarily conquering it from the north moving up to the western coast of india we get to that tar desert near the current indian pakistani border it looks more like a scene from arabia with camels but the people in customs are decidedly indian moving up along the western parts of india we get to the indus river region which consists itself of two sub-regions the first descend at the southern mouth of the indus river second and farther north is the punjab which comes from the persian for five waters referring to the five tributaries from the himalayas that enter into the indus river which then empties into the arabian sea moving farther northwest we get to the famed khyber pass a narrow transit route through mountains which straddle the border between modern afghanistan and pakistan the khyber pass traditionally has been the transit route for invaders muslim sultans the muggles and akbar it was the key link between india ir and the islamic middle east now that we've gotten a lay of the land let's move on to an overview of hinduism hinduism is one of the world's great religious traditions but it's difficult to define exactly what hinduism is i could teach a whole course on hinduism but for the purposes of this course we're going to have to do a more condense zte version hinduism is a religion philosophy and cosmology all rolled into one it's as much a way of life and it is as it is a religious system unlike the three abrahamic religions of christianity judaism and islam hinduism has no single founder it's the accumulation of various practices adaptations and local customs wrapped into a broader tradition that has been largely located in the indian subcontinent now let's go into some of hinduism basics we like to think of religions as either monotheistic or polytheistic but hinduism defies either categorization while it has over three thousand larger and lesser deities it does believe in a supreme creator so the best description of hinduism would be henan theistic meaning that there's one supreme being or central divinity but at the same time there are multitudes of other lesser gods and goddesses the understanding is that since humans are limited in their perception of the cosmos and the divine different people who have different ethnicities cultures and views will all see god in very different ways there's an old allegory that since humans are all limited in what we can understand about the divine we're all blindfolded and if we're reaching for the same elephant for example we're going to see it and feel it differently for example if you touch the whiskers you might think that the divine is gentle if you get hit by the elephant he'll you'll think god's vengeful if you happen to end up next to the elephants poo well you might be a cynical nihilist the allegory is used to illustrate how hinduism views revelation and truth in religion generally accepts that all paths go to the same end that is god this logically to her hinduism explains the diversity of the world's religions or as an old saying goes god is one but wise people know him by many names now hinduism is as much a religion as it is a philosophy and this is unlike judaism christianity and islam which have traditionally separated religion and faith from philosophy and metaphysics but in hinduism religion,1
B002V57XFM,the book was published in december nineteen thirty one when i came to plan the present volume it was clear that some overlapping would be necessary for obviously the story of the nineteen thirties should start before the panic and give some idea of the high place from which the country fell during the economic collapse of nineteen twenty nine to nineteen thirty two hence my decision to begin with a study of things as as they were on september third nineteen twenty nine which i had written in somewhat different form as an article in harper's magazine in nineteen thirty seven and in a second chapter to cover the panic and the course of events up to the spring of nineteen thirty one the story of the panic itself however i have abbreviated in this book since i told it in considerable detail in only yesterday the problem of selection and emphasis always difficult is of course doubly difficult when one is writing so close to the event in only yesterday i brought into sharp relief manners and customs bads and follies and everyday circumstances of life in the present volume i have done the same thing to some agree but not quite as much for the heart of the story of america in the nineteen thirties was obviously the enormous economic and political transformation which took place and such trivialities as had been the essence of life in the united states in the nineteen twenties where now it seemed to me less significant future events may make my selection and appraisal of material look very dated in that case i can only hope my very miscalculations may have a certain paradoxical value as indicating the sort of pitfall into which one readily fell in nineteen thirty nine even if one were conscientiously intent upon presenting a fair appraisal frederick lewis allen chapter one prelude september third nineteen twenty nine one do you remember what you were doing on september third nineteen twenty nine probably not unless you have an altogether exceptional memory let me refresh your recollection for if we are to understand the changes in american life during the nineteen thirties we must first recall what things were like before this period began before the panic which introduced the depression perhaps the most convenient way of doing this is to imagine ourselves reliving a single day in nineteen twenty nine seeing what things look like listening to the talk glancing at the newspapers and magazines and books noticing what are the preoccupations and assumptions and expectations in people's minds and doing all this with the eyes and ears and intellectual perspective of today i have chosen september third nineteen twenty nine as the day to revisit for it was then that the big bull market reached its peak that the dow jones average of stock market prices which had been rising so long and so furiously made it's high record for all time if there was any single day when the wave of prosperity at e and of speculation which characterized the nineteen twenties may be said to have attained it's utmost height before it curled over and crashed september third nineteen twenty nine was that day so let us go back and look about us two it is a very hot day this first tuesday in september nineteen twenty nine not everywhere to be sure in the far west and south the temperatures are moderate but from the coast of maine to the wheat fields of nebraska the sun beats down implacably yesterday was labor day and last night as the long holiday weekend came to its close the suburban highways approaching the larger american cities were nightmares of congestion as endless lines of cars full of sunburned sweltering vacationers then weekenders crept city word through the night inch by angry inch on the new jersey highways leading to new york the tie up was so complete that people by the thousands hopeless of reaching the holland tunnel for hours parked their cars in newark or hoboken and finished the journey to new york by tube the railroad stations too were jammed with people not only vacation ists and weekenders but boy and girl campers returning to town on moss never had labor day traffic been so overwhelming or the collective discomfort of labor day travel been greater there were of course no air conditioned cars as you get up on tuesday morning september third after an airless night the weather prediction in the morning paper offers you no relief bear and continued warm today and tomorrow it says,1
B06X9P85VZ,her two grandfathers had taken her for a high speed ride in an antique gasoline powered ford pickup she remembered being terrified sitting on grandpa austin's lap as he wrenched the steering wheel and stomped the pedals manhandling the big loud machine along a winding country road while grandpa rudolf bay bellowed from the passenger seat for them to go faster such childhood terrors had been overcome long ago replaced by the more abiding fears of adulthood besides she'd been assured by e-tec security that the driver was highly skilled next skepticism of security now notwithstanding he and his companion came across as professionally competent the bodyguards monitored police and e m s channels through their arab boys frosted eyeglasses fed them real time data from the vehicle's sensors and high altitude drones that scan the route ahead for potential threats they carried projectile and energy weapons in the words of bullet wiki the blustery security chief the men trained to protect you are highly skilled professionals ready to address any operational crisis but bell had learned from some of her contacts and security that operational crisis was occur code phrase used by the department for situations that excluded the presence of para trois assassins translated it meant that in the event the royal cast gave the order to have her killed the bodyguards would be as useless as everyone else in stopping it we have to do something about that she wasn't thinking specific ethically about the attack on headquarters realistically she knew that if the royal cast wanted her dead little could be done to prevent it assassinations paw killings in nick's parlance as well as mma attacks such as the bio toxin that had devastated kazan city were nearly impossible to prevent still the pa and ma attacks represented a minority of para trois related incidents most of the conflicts involve some form of open battle often with a company or battalion of soldiers pitted against a single assassin such firefights inevitably resulted in a terrible loss of human life and even then the pair of trois usually escaped that led to the demoralizing perception among the citizenry that the assassins were invulnerable now that she was the director she vowed to surreptitiously steer some of the texts vast resources toward the goal of finding a way to change that perception e t a is ten minutes ma'am the driver announced thank you she was heading to the imperious the new convention center south of downtown the e-tec fundraiser aimed at soliciting new patrons had been planned months before director wither stones assassination bell would give opening remarks before introducing dr emanuel as the main speaker she should be using the ride to fine tune those remarks yet she found her thoughts again turning to this morning's encounter with nick what he'd revealed had extraordinary ramifications she still found it difficult to accept that the royals wanted her running e-tec if true she couldn't fathom the reasoning even more disturbing was that the ash ok apparently could function as two individuals rather than just halves of a single person but most surprising of all were the annoying notions churning through her since seeing nick notions that had nothing whatsoever to do with her advancement or para trois assassins he didn't compliment me on my attire in preparation for their meeting she'd worn the only a line brocade dress she owned she'd also donned a pair of slingback high heels they were the same type of shoes she'd worn the day of the attack and which had her earned his praise as she huddled in the closet but he didn't utter a single compliment not a word that she was dwelling on such things was absurd she was acting like some preteen girl hyperventilating over a first crush she forced herself to view the situation logically why on earth would she expect pr praise from nyc and why would she want it he wasn't her type he came from a different time a different world he had a street savvy that was almost unheard of with an e-tec the two of them had little in common she couldn't deny that nick's combination of keen intelligence and shadowy skills was enticing she'd always been attracted to such men but he wasn't exactly in the same financial sphere as bell as well as her family and friends most of whom were quite well off despite her egalitarian beliefs she knew that romantic entanglements between those who came,0
B002V0K5RA,while roll-in and vandiver and hattaway are in the same ballpark perhaps even the same ballgame they definitely are playing different positions my main goal was to focus particularly upon certain military aspects of the american civil war and to relate them more broadly to technological and managerial realities to fit the story of eighteen sixty one eighteen sixty five conflict into the context of evolving military possibilities and necessity the nineteenth century was a time of emergent military professionalism and the civil war experience perhaps paradoxically both inhibited a normal development in this country toward incorporating that ethic within the martial structure and rendered poignant lessons that pointed to the absolute necessity of doing so thereafter prologue the dawn of military professionalism and an era of great technological change the american civil war still after more than a century and a quarter elicits enormous interest from a myriad of enthusiasts ranging from scholars to casually interested students to hobbyists and buffs and to those who enjoy dressing in authentic costumes and using period equipment to reenact many of the battlefields are lovingly preserved and maintained and they attract millions of visitors year after year the war was fought with tremendous determination and sacrifice by a great and hugely fascinating cast of characters the mass of the participants was literate this was the first big war in human history in which that was so and therefore there is an enormous body of written records of all types despite the north's many obvious advantages there was not entirely impossible that the south might prevail for the weaker side does sometimes win in war it is useful to remember to not the nature of the civil war was much molded and affected by it's historical context and further that some of what followed thereafter and military history was affected by what had happened in the civil war during the nineteenth century throughout the western world first in europe then subsequently in america enormous changes occurred and these changes had a profound impact on how warfare would be conducted most notable there evolved increased division of labor populations also increased continuing a trend that had commenced during the preceding century cities grew industrialism came more and more to predominate finally the invention or assignment of many new machines and devices brought a technological revolution three technological development in particular had an inestimable impact on transportation and communication and therefore also on warfare these were the steamship the railroad and the electric telegraph and eighteen o seven the american inventor robert fulton produced the first commercially feasible steamboat subsequently he designed seventeen other steamboats a torpedo boat and a ferry he also built a steam frigate which was launched in eighteen fifteen later the screw propeller the work of a swedish engineer john ericsson provided more efficient propulsion for steamboat and also rendered war vessels less vulnerable to being disabled by damage to the large exposed paddle wheel still more protection came when iron armor was added to wooden ships the french pioneered this innovation commencing construction in nineteen fifty seven of the galois the first of a class of vessels wooden steam powered warships with holes covered by a belt of iron that was five inches thick the british quickly followed suit when the age of armor clad boats had dawned other inventors soon applied steam power to land transportation and eighteen fourteen the englishman george stephenson developed a railway locomotive the rocket within a single generation after the battle of waterloo an elaborate matrix of rail lines laced both western europe then the eastern united states on may twenty fourth nineteen forty four the american inventor samuel f b morris sent the first telegraphic message what hath god wrought between washington and baltimore just sixteen years later the nation possessed transcontinental telegraph connection from the military perspective the most mind boggling technological developments came in firepower the variety range and accuracy of weapons vastly increased the causes for these changes were the introduction of the percussion cap and the invention of a bullet that made rifle board shoulder weapons practicable for use by all soldiers early rifles were regarded as sporting nor hunting firearms and not well suited to military use except for specialty applications such as long range sniping the enormous and time consuming problem of muzzle loading a rifle with a sufficiently tight fitting bullet was resolved during the eighteen forties by two french army officers captains henri gustave delvin and clawed at and ye many developed the hollow base cylinder can oddly shaped led many bullet often miss nam and the mini ball the rifle would still be loaded from the muzzle but the projectile could be slightly smaller than the rifle bore hence easily ram down the barrel upon firing the bullet would expand and the lead would grip tightly against the spiral rifling grooves thus a spin will be placed on the elongated bullet and it would leave the muzzle at a higher velocity and follow a truer trajectory traveling from three to four times farther than when fired from a smoothbore musket warfare and like everything else in society became more complex quite suddenly it had become possible to convey armies rapidly the battlefield to have them arrive less fatigued and better able to commence operations immediately and to communicate with them easily efficiently and quickly very large forces now with more lethal weaponry could be maintained and kept concentrating for long periods of time because they could be supplied rather than have to rely on foraging the need for management of a higher order forced it's way into the military equation in response a new form of revitalized military professionalism emerged miss professionalism evolved slowly sometimes haltingly it took new directions usually only after painful lessons were learned by experience the emergence of revitalized military professionalism three factors further contributed to the development of military professionalism these were the growth of the nation state the rise of democratic ideals and parties and the existence of a single recognized source of legitimate authority over the nation state military forces putting emphasis on on and rewarding good performances within the officer corps in the countries where it came and to be sure this occurred in various countries at vastly different moments in time made it possible for individual merit rather than social or political position to be the primary prerequisite for commissioning and for promotion modern military professionalism defined modern military professionalism came into being when military officers became professional men distinguished from warriors of previous ages pioneers tuned to the topic such as the renowned samuel p huntington suggest that it was a phenomenon that commenced early and discreetly late in the nineteenth century in prussia more recent scholarship especially that of russell f widely sheds light on an emerging military professionalism throughout the modern period of history similarly students of american military professionalism previously focused almost exclusively on it's full blown manifestation late in the nineteenth and early in the twentieth century while the historians roy p robert and william r skelton have illustrated a gradual development with deep historical roots the distinguishing characteristics of a profession or it's knowledge ability responsibility and corporate ness professional knowledge being intellectual in nature can be preserved in writing to possess it requires some knowledge of it's history,1

B07SGXW5QY,into some beast bird plant or insect but always the results and beast or other creature corresponds in some power of mind or in some leading quality of the character with the god from whose position it has fallen in certain single cases opponents are closely matched they are nearly equal in combat the struggle between them as long uncertain and difficult at last one one side is triumphant the victor says hereafter you will be nothing butter and he tells what the vanquished is to be but at this point the vanquish turns on the victor and sends his retort like a parthian arrow you will be nothing but a and he declares what his enemy is to be the metamorphosis takes place immediately on both sides and each depart in the form which the enemy seemed to impose but which really belonged to him there are cases in which the hero transforms numerous and mighty enemies indirectly through a special wish which he possesses for example a certain myth hero brings it about that a large company of the first people are invited to a feast and while all are eating with great relish he slips out unnoticed walks around the house and utters as he goes the magic formula i wish the walls of this house to be flint the roof also next moment the whole houses flint walled the roof is flint also after that he says i wished this house to be red hot it is red hot immediately his enemies inside are in a dreadful predicament they rush about wildly they roar they look for an opening there is none they see no escape they find no issue their heads burst from heat out of one head springs an owl and flies away through the smoke hole out of another a buzzard which escapes through the same place out of the third comes a hawk which follows the other two out of a four if some other bird thus the action continues till every head in the flint house bursts open and lets out it's occupant all fly away and thus the whole company is metamorphosed each turns into that which has qualities called for which his nature demanded he becomes outwardly and visibly that which before he had been internally and in secret the hero in the above case could not wish his opponents metamorphose directly he could not wish this whenever he pleased or whenever he met the great company he had to induce them to enter the house which he turned by his wish into flint and then heated when the moment of terrible anguish came on them the true nature of each of those people grew evident each head burst open and out sprang the real person all those of the first people whose minds had been modified who so to speak had grown specialized internally who were different from that which they had been to start with were forced to change also externally and could not escape or avoid that great power who shadow was approaching their destiny was on them and they felt it in the winter system one of the two which are set before in this volume nearly all changes were affected by all elvis but there are examples of agents with other means torture harris turns old to chalice into a ground squirrel at the climax of his perfidy he changes heart the porter at the dangerous river into a lamprey eel whose children are to be eaten by indians in the future old sas the false and vain chief and sask he will is beaten by his son-in-law and receives his present form of sun and moon at the end of a long and bitter struggle in which strength wit and keenness use the very last of their resources there are cases in which some of the first people are so modify mentally that they are conscious of what has happened within them they are ready for the change they are willing to undergo it but there is no immediate occasion no impending struggle in which an opponent could have the chance to transform them these people transform themselves by the utterance of a wish and produce their own metamorphosis there are still others who know as do all that a new race is coming and that they will be changed when it comes unless they are changed some time earlier they know that they must be changed as soon as they see the new people or a sign or a mark of their coming these unchanged first people view a number comparatively attempt to escape but their attempts are vain their efforts are useless in the distant east they see smoke from the the fires of the advancing new people the indians of america or hear the barking of the dogs of this people and that instant they receive the forms which are due them others escape for a season and hide in dark places but the indians go everywhere and the metamorphoses continue until the career of the first people is ended i have in mind in this moment a representative picture of this last group of persons who were unwilling to be metamorphosed and strove to avoid the new race the inevitable indians they had no desire to see men and they fled to all sorts of lonely retreats and remote forest places at a certain point on the

1682769925,in spite of his denials it was clear that america's system for keeping presidential power in check had worked nixon's resignation was unprecedented the first time that an american president had not served out his full term of office for any reason other than death but presidential investigations have occurred throughout american history in nineteen ninety eight an investigation of president clinton in which i myself participated resulted in clinton's impeachment for lying about an extramarital affair although he remained in office each investigation our feels new to us perhaps because each seems to test new aspects of executive power and the nation's willingness to limit it as of the date of this lecture a new investigation is underway this one of president donald trump and the possibility that his election campaign colluded with the russian government in its efforts to influence the outcome of the twenty sixteen election we can't know at this juncture what the invoice instigations result will be but once again our system has been put to the test perhaps all the more so because our national politics and social discourse have become so extraordinarily polarized that's why i believe that now is an important time to consider carefully weather systems that we have established we're investigating presidents are up to the task it's especially important to consider this question in a climate of sharp political division because it is all too tempting for both politicians and ordinary citizens to approach an investigation with an attitude of my party right or wrong but the thesis of this course is different my view is that there is a body of history and law and policy that can and should guide the response of the body politic any citizen who wants to have a dispassionate view of issues relating to presidential power and the misuse of that power what in all fairness to try to situate his or her opinions within the context of our system of governance perhaps that's overly optimistic to think that there's more than mere politics to the idea of presidential authority and abuse indeed if you hold a mannequin view this course is probably not for you in reality though lying behind the patina of political dispute there is a series of institutions and was that guide and govern and our response over the past two hundred and forty years we have developed systems for the restraint of power and time and again they've been a bulwark for the nation we can see that there are more common themes about presidential authority across american history than there are divergences and the structure of our government gives america the architecture for how to deal with allegations of presidential misconduct in short the idea behind this lecture series is that the investigation of presidential misconduct can and should be guided by history law and policy and make no mistake the question of constraining power is of critical importance to the functioning of democratic institutions with great power comes great responsibility but our nation's founders knew very well that not all power is used in a responsible manner before sure we can examine the effectiveness of presidential investigations therefore we need to begin our consideration with an examination of the nature and extent of presidential power the american presidency is truly a unique institution on the world stage no other position of power is quite like it and the majestic terror of the job has been apparent to all who have eldred consider how george washington expressed his concerns in his first inaugural address delivered to the members of congress in april seventeen eighty nine quote among the vicissitudes incident to life no event could have filled me with greater anxieties than that of which the notification was transmitted by your order and received on the fourteenth day of the present month on the one hand i was summoned by my country whose voice i can never here but with veneration and love from,1
B002V0Q5FQ,surprising ways several years after i married my father-in-law called me aside for a confidential talk he and his wife were of an older generation than my parents they had come to america in their early thirties with two children and had already seen something of the world my father-in-law had in fact served in the russian army during the russo-japanese war of ninety no four to ninety no five now he was disturbed over a matter of some delicacy it turned out that my parents had failed to present their new son-in-law with a tallis prayer shawl on our marriage this was a source of steady personal embarrassment to my father-in-law since his son came frequently to his little soul to join him in the services of and was still wearing his little boys tell us given to him when he was thirteen upon his marriage he should have put on an adult dallas made of wool and that hung to the knees the cause of the problem soon became clear there was no ill will on the part of my parents this was not a subtle display of displeasure with their son-in-law their omission of this traditional gift was due to sheer ignorance when they had left the old country and it's intricate social web my parents had each been too young to i have noticed this custom for them as for their children it was lost like so much else what they had not learned what they did not know they could not transmit culturally then these children as adults skating on very thin ice wedded to the culture they had brought with them and it's language yet not really adept in it and once in america it was too late to learn any more but how american where they once again there is a whole spectrum of example as there were those who persevered in making themselves american went on to high school even to college and entered professional careers others lived their whole lives in a strange never never land speaking a very shallow version of the language they had brought with them and later learning an equally shallow version of the language of their new country for all of them it took heroic efforts just to stay afloat to keep their jobs and it took a very adventurous temperament to move ahead sometimes when he reflected on compatriots who had grown rich in this country my old father-in-law used to say with a satisfied twinkle in his eye i am a rich man because i have no debts it was a cautious frame of mind and for those whom it suited it was a moral refuge he did not have to measure his success against the rich and powerful by the standards of the old world of the shtetl he was a success he had employment he had a home he and his family did not live in want there was another kind of refuge in the many densely populated yiddish speaking neighborhoods of new york city it was often unnecessary to worry too much about the american world from the perspective of brownsville or the bronx and fact that world seemed very far away and often quite unintelligible in these neighborhood one could spend a lifetime and never have to speak a word of english at the stores at work even the doctors at the board of health clinics if you pick the right one every one spoke yiddish living in this dense yiddish speaking world my mother was convinced that young doctors were taught yiddish in medical school as one of the indispensable tools of their trade in eighteen seventy a decade before the great influx from eastern europe began the eighty thousand jews in new york city were largely of german origin they were joined after eighteen thirty by some two hundred thousand german jews who abandoned their homeland and of whom more than a third had landed in new york the landscape of jewish life in america however was permanently changed by the sheer number of the new arrivals from the east by nineteen fifteen there were one million four hundred thousand jews in new york city half of the jews in the united states publishing for yiddish language newspapers daily as well as countless additional journals and magazines representing a broad array of social cultural and political convictions there were cafes the restaurants and cabarets geared to the old country taste there was a thriving yiddish theater there seemed to be a landsman shaft organization for every town in eastern europe and a very large number of vehement political groups socialists zionists and a zionist and many shades in between for many immigrants the landsman shaft organization was a kind of substitute family where they heard again the accent of their home and felt the warmth of shared memories with their fellow members more practically these self help groups also looked out for the newcomers paid sick and unemployment benefits and bought group plots and cemeteries in the outer boroughs where their members could remain together through eternity the uncertainty of these child immigrants coloured and shaped their adult lives much of the intensity and hysteria that became the hallmark of jewish family life was less extravagant warmth and love as it has often been seen than a true representation of the fear and double incompetence of these children w because they had not been able to master either of the cultures in which they lived their children early came to recognize this incapacity as at an early age they were required to read and interpret notices from the gas company from school as well as other official communications that came in the mail the very appearance of these letters would throw the parents into a panic only allayed with difficulty when it to turned out that the gas company was notifying it's subscribers that there would be a temporary suspension of service on the next tuesday between nine and eleven am very very early very quietly the children of this generation developed an area of reserve that widened with time as their own world grew more complex then they turned to teachers to their peers to the leaders of clubs that they had joined to almost anyone else for advice but not to their parents they learned to bring home only the good news to suppress anything that had any ambivalence that would arouse an outburst of anxiety and emotion that went nowhere and solve no problems their parents could offer passionate feelings and unlimited devotion they learned but what they needed was cool consideration of the facts against a background of worldly experience by and large these children of children had to learn to negotiate their own way in the new world to which they had been born they sought advice at home at their own peril studying that other world became a lifelong occupation than one never knew when something seemingly trivial but totally new would illuminate an entire area of experience i report all this at first hand my own parents were just such immigrant children when they came to this country my mother from a tiny town in galicia arrived with her sister hannah when she was thirteen and the fauna was fourteen taking advantage of the opportunity to travel across the ocean with a woman who was their neighbor they were the last of the five children in their family to leave for the new world their pious old father a follower of the hardcover rebbi remained behind rather than live in what he called a tray for medina an unholy land later when his children send him money from their earnings he implored them to desist sure that it came from tainted labor that is money earned on the sabbath my father arrived at ellis island as a boy of sixteen or seventeen he was never certain of his age and came from a small town near bialystok it was so small that he was ashamed to tell us and at first would always say that he came from bialystok itself in time he spoke of picton to and still a town of some size and finally when he was in his nineties he admitted that he had been born in root key a villa idg a few miles west of bialystok it took a long time before we realized that these evasions were about something that was invisible to us for him it was somehow shameful that he came from a village a shtetl and like much else he suppressed what he considered unsuitable in america discovering the world our world under these circumstances also took a long time without a map in hand we were constantly plotting new points and trying to discover what kind of terrain we were standing on one weekend when i was in my twenties i was invited to visit some friends in their summer house in new england they had three children and lived very comfortably in an old farmhouse that they had made delightfully livable it had unobtrusively all the mechanical conveniences of modern life but all the charm of the nineteenth century here and there they had found furniture appropriate to the size and style of the house some of it family pieces and some bought at country auctions a horsehair sofa a square rosewood piano some straight chairs and some comfortable ones disposed informally and invitingly around the living music room i was a little nervous about this weekend because this was the first non,1

B07NWZK45M,prologue where to begin where to begin okay my name is eddie hart i'm a private detective no that's probably not a good place to start i could start six months ago when i open my new office in beverly hills but that really isn't a beginning as much as it is a middle i could be really dramatic and start by saying this is the city los angeles california nineteen forty but i've never been that dramatic and lines like that only sound really good when there's heavy background music and i'm fresh out of the moment the fact that i mentioned background music is probably a sign that i've dealt with the hollywood studios and their stars too many times for my own good okay i think i got it this time i am standing on the balcony of a very expensive beach house in malibu the house isn't mine it belongs to a friend the woman standing on the other end of the balcony is my fiance and business partner her name is claire olson we share the same balcony at the beach house but not the same bedroom she was quite clear on that matter being a farm girl from iowa she didn't believe in any form of cohabitation before marriage and i respected that i've also seen her shoot a gun so that respect is founded on some things that run deeper than just my personal moral code in the spirit of full disclosure i should probably also mention that clear not only fired her gun she hit her target he was a nazi spy but that's another story by the way he lived but somewhere in federal prison there's a man with a bad limp who's possessed of a unique respect for petite blonde women from iowa so having said all that n in the best tradition of the hollywood flashback our story can continue lights camera speed and action,0

B016V21AXG,the front door opened and a woman walked in i had been working on my mac pro in an attempt to complete the answer to the question of a client i'd taken on the week before the question involved an asp a high diving board and a quantity of bourbon but it was not noteworthy enough to explore here i had agreed to answer the question because i had not worked in six days and needed the mental exercise the fee was also a consideration questions answered had been open for six months i'd rented the storefront at seven thirty five stilton road in piscataway new jersey because it was close to the house in which my the mother and i live it was adequate to my needs which were minimal and it was affordable since then i had advertised sparingly and through that activity and some word of mouth and expression that makes very little sense to me since words written on paper or pixels are just as effective i had managed to keep busy most of the time time the business had been in operation the woman who was approximately twenty seven years old five foot six and brown haired and i'd looked nervous as she scanned the room it is not an unusual response among people who enter my establishment before i opened questions answered the building had been devoe voted to a pizzeria called san ramos the ovens that had been used to create the chief product of that retail operation were still in the room although i had never attempted to operate them i must admit however that curiosity did sometimes cause me to consider doing so the rest of the large room larger than i needed but adequate to my needs and open to the possibility of experimentation was devoted to a desk in the center at which i was currently seated or reclining chair to one side where my mother often sad when she visited the office and two posts supporting the ceiling much of the room was empty but it was clean it has been sick suggested to me that the walls could benefit from a coat of paint but i had not seen the utility since there is no data of which i'm aware suggesting that people are more apt to ask interesting questions if the surroundings have been recently painted may i help you i asked the woman i had trained myself to ask that question by natural impulse would be to discover the nature of the potential clients question but mother says that people find such directness disturbing i never ask can i help you it confuses me when a person at a store or business asks me that i i have no idea if that person is capable of helping me before he or she knows the nature of my interest i am certain i can help most of the people who walk in to ask questions but statistically it is true that i will not be able to answer every question i have not yet been asked one that i could not answer but it is theoretically possible i i am not sure the woman said is this like a detective agency so it would be easy to deflect this interaction because my business is nothing like a detective agency no i said this is questions answered i gestured toward the sign i have displayed in the front window on which i had clearly written the business name in permanent marker mother says i should invest in a more professional looking sign and i suppose i should since she is usually right about such things instead of appearing discouraged the woman took five five more steps toward me i stood since i have been told by dr mancuso that it is viewed as impolite to sit while a person with whom one is conversing remained standing i held out my hand as i have practised allow me to introduce myself i said i am samuel hoenig i am the proprietor of questions answered and if i have a question that requires some investigation you can handle that it was not technically a question but her tone with an increase of two and a half tones at the end of the sentence indicated she believed it to be one i answered as if i agreed that she had asked it would depend on the question i said most questions require some research but not all need outside investigation,0

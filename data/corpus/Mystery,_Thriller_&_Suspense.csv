B0054S6WBE,the just business like a right anderson the red by thomas judd the prologue november two thousand and eight the i was sitting on the beach watching the two guys hassling the hippy and desperately trying to remember why should be scared even from afar the two figures look vaguely familiar but a dope fueled haze it prevented me from reaching a vitally important conclusion straightaway if i didn't leave immediately there was every chance i'd be dead within a minute i stood up in his nonchalant fashion as possible and put my sunglasses on the two heavily tanned dark haired men one short and squat the other tall and angular was showing old deva photo and asking questions although i couldn't hear what they were saying that manner was menacing even from this distance i could tell that dave who was sitting down almost in the load his position was nervous diego and juan had made some effort to not stand out amongst the westerners lying around on sarongs by wearing baggy beach shorts and ill fitting garish indian t-shirts however their tidy mustaches and well maintained haircuts were most certainly out of place amongst the travelers on this particular beach it was gradually dawning on me that despite their superficially calm demeanor these two men had somehow followed me halfway round the world to kill me i turn my back on the sea and began walking towards my battered motorbike feeling the hot sand beneath my feet my eyes never leaving the two men who are questioning dave they stood over him twenty short paces to my right without looking down i unzipped my bum bag and started rooting around for the bike key even though the enfield was still many yards away my heart was pounding like a bass drum and i was sweating profusely beneath my artificial calm i prayed over and over again that the two guys would not look over in my direction suddenly die of glanced towards me the eyes of my two would be assassins instinctively followed his and immediately widened with recognition without a moment's pause i broke into a sprint leaping onto my bike i flicked up the stand and after two nervous frantic attempts finally managed to slit the key into the ignition i twisted it to the right but the colombians were already running towards me one was reaching into his bag for something something i didn't need to see to know what it was i now had about five seconds to start my ever unreliable royal enfield bullet i'd tried to steady myself but i was shaking like a leaf i slammed my right foot down on the kick-start but my foot slipped off the greasy pedal tearing a gash in my ankle i lost my balance and the bike almost toppled over but i ignore the pain stamped the pedal down again pulled the throttle back and heard what at that moment was without doubt the most beautiful noise in the world the deep popping sound the three hundred and fifty cc four stroke engine starting up i pulled the clutch in clumped into first gear and went heavy on the throttle i rode off along the sandy dirt track and turn round to see my two assailants shouting obscenities at heaven but the feeling of relief was momentary a second nervous glance into my one remaining winger revealed juan diego running towards two nearby hondas both holding keys in their hands i haven't told anyone what really forced me to leave the city in late two thousand and seven and believe me the press reports got it all wrong admittedly they mainly got it wrong because of the misinformation are drip fed them something i had to do in order to protect my bony ass now i'm going to tell you what really happened and it's a story so outrageous that even i can barely believe it yet all of it is totally true an insane moment of great set in motion a series of events that turn my life upside down it means that i'll never feel safe again i have endangered my life and the lives of those i love have a want a quick buck in a sick world everything that we've witnessed over the past three years reveals just how out of control things have become in the world of finance the lunatics truly have taken over the asylum hardly a day has gone by without some selfish degenerate striving to outdo his twisted banker mates for some appalling act of self serving greed for the first few months of my forced exile i could hardly believe what i was reading on the internet but each callous feet of fathomless avarice seemed to be superseded by the next and i like most of the dumb schmucks on this planet grew numb to them jerome kerviel four point nine billion euro trading loss looks like a rounding error compared to the fifty billion dollar ponzi scheme organised by bernie mac aid of meanwhile those charmless scumbags at goldman sachs keep proving themselves to be the most vicious repugnant cock suckers this world has ever seen amazingly despite bankers' best efforts to bring pain and suffering to their fellow man while lining their own silt pockets finance remains relatively unregulated and the despicable slots are still raking in bonus is so vast they bring tears to the eyes of all right thinking people most city boys lie cheat,1

B002V0JTYA,extensively on our discoveries modesty prevents me from claiming too large a share of the scholarly reputation we had earned but emerson would have been the first to proclaim that we were a partnership in archaeology as in marriage from the sandy wastes of the cemeteries of memphis to the rocky cliffs of the theban the cra plus we had wandered hand in hand figuratively speaking in terrain almost as inhospitable as the desert that presently surrounded us never before however had we been more than a few miles from the nile and it's life giving water it lay far behind us now and there was not a pyramid or a broken wall to be seen much less a tree or a sign of habitation what indeed were we doing there without camels we were marooned on a sea of sand and our situation was infinitely more desperate than that of shipwrecked sailors i seated myself upon the ground with my back against the camel the sun was at the zenith the only shade was cast by the body of the poor beast emerson paced back and forth kicking up clouds of sand and swearing his expertise in this latter exercise had earned him the admiring title of father of curses as from our egyptian workmen and on this occasion he surpassed himself i sympathized with his feelings but duty compelled me to remonstrate you forget yourself emerson i remarked indicating our companions they stood side by side watching me with grave concern and i must say they made a ludicrous pay pair many of the native nylon peoples are unusually tall and it the only servant remaining to us was over six feet in height he wore a turban and a loose robe of woven blue and white cotton his face with it's clean cut features and deeply bronzed skin bore a striking resemblance to that of his companion but the second individual was less than four feet tall he was also my son walter peabody emerson known as ramses who should not have been there emerson cut off his expletive in mid syllable though the effort almost choked him still in need of event for his boiling emotions he focused them on me who selected these debt these curses camels you know perfectly well who selected them i replied i always select the animals for our expeditions and doctor them to the local people treat camels and donkeys so badly don't give me one of your lectures on veterinary medicine and kindness to animals emerson bellowed i knew i knew your delusions about your medical knowledge would lead us into disaster one day you have been dosing these dent these confer founded animals what did you give them emerson are you accusing me of poisoning the camels i struggled to overcome the indignation his outrageous accusation had provoked i believe you have taken leave of your senses well and if i have there is some excuse for me emerson said in a a more moderate tone he edged closer to me our situation is desperate enough to disturb any man even one as even tempered as i am i beg your pardon my dear peabody don't cry emerson calls me amelia only when he is annoyed with me peabody is my maiden name and it was thus that emerson in one of his feeble attempts at sarcasm addressed may during the early days of our acquaintance hallowed by fond memories it has now become a private pet name so to speak indicative of affection and respect btw i lowered the handkerchief i had raised my eyes and smiled at him a few grains of sand in my eye emerson that is all you will never find me succumbing to helpless tears when firmness is required as you are well aware said emerson all the same mama said ramsey's papa has raised a point where they have consideration it is surely a stretching coincidence to the point of impossibility to assume that all the camels should die suddenly and with no symptoms of disease within forty eight hours of one another i assure you ramsay's that consideration had already occurred to me run in fear edge pop his head if you please no emerson i know your dislike of hats but i insist that you put it on we are in bad enough case without having you laid low by sunstroke emerson made no reply his eyes were fixed on the small figure of his son trotting obediently after the sun helmet and his expression was so poignant that my eyes dimmed it was not fear for himself that weakened my husband nor even concern for me we had faced death together not once but many times he knew he could count on me to meet that grim adversary with a smile and a stiff upper lip no it was the probable fate of ramsey's that brought the moisture to his keen,1
B01LWSYZEA,i should not be so inclined stated mr short combs from his stool at the chemical table in the corner i roused myself from the brown study into which i had fallen as the morning progressed with a sigh i pulled my gaze from the rain streaked windows and back to homes and to what would you be referring i asked holmes did not speak for a mower mint as he leaned closer to the elaborate glass apparatus before him titillating some violet colored liquid between the interconnected pieces of narrow tubing he placed his eyes level with the thin vertical structures clamped in place above the blue gas flame that flickered across his sharp features i started to utter a warning afraid the color of his dressing gown would touch the flame but it proved to be unnecessary then satisfied with the results holmes leaned back stretching like a cat and shifted to face me i would not be so inclined to record the events of the last couple of days in your journals our recent trip to kent is hardly worth preserving for posterity the matter was simply child's play and was quickly resolved by means of a single telegram to my professional contacts in ohio it really is not worth the effort that would be expended in adding it to your notes i straightened in my chair i must disagree homes your analysis of the matter was mad masterful you brought peace of mind to that unhappy young man and incidentally who did capture a murderer holmes turned back toward his research leaned toward the deal table and reached for his pen with his left hand he pulled a sheet of paper toward him already half covered with cryptic notes nevertheless my thoughts that morning had indeed touched upon the events of the previous day in kent and the audacious scheme the wily american had planned the if holmes and i had not been summoned doubtless the fellow would have accomplished his goals and escaped unscathed but i had been having other thoughts as well more personal and grim then just the facts relating to our recent investigation perhaps homes realized that and had chosen to direct the conversation toward my literary efforts rather than let me brood as had been my habit the last few months or possibly homes did not realize the true path of my thoughts at all but knowing home homes that was unlikely indeed i shook my head and tried to turn my thinking to other matters but as i glanced around the sitting room so filled with souvenirs and relics from homes past investigations i realized that very little of my own possessions were in evidence it had only been a little over one hundred days since i had returned to baker street and i wondered if it was time for me to think about getting back into harness and finding a new practice how different were those one hundred days from what i had planned for the rest of my life and how different would the next hundred be and the hundred after that i decided to respond to homes query out of politeness if for no other reason if he had actually made an effort to distract me as he had done so often since the events of last december i was obliged to return his folly if only out of friendly gratitude for the trouble that he was taking such as it was i looked back at the pile of newspapers littering our dining table souvenirs of our most recent investigation they had drawn my attention all morning and how i asked did you know that i was thinking of our recent trip to sissinghurst homes patiently stilled the pen for just a moment that did not turn to face me it took narrowed deduction i assure you he replied and then recommenced writing in his careful precise way after you finished your breakfast who carried the mementos of our investigation to the table then you move to your desk where you're stood for some three hundred,1
B005HR4ADO,couldn't stand for that to happen and fluffy was a lot faster than she was and quickly ran out of sight montana followed the sound of shrieks and screams making her way through the streets of the town dodging a peanut card and narrowly missing a close encounter with two guys on bikes she turned a corner just in time to see a tail disappearing through the automatic doors of a tall building no montana breathed staring up at the hospital not there anywhere but there she raced forward inwardly cringing at the thought of what fluffy could do in a place like that big puppy feet on slippery floors were not a happy company nation she ran up the six steps leading to the entrance and dashed inside only to find a trail of havoc marking the way a supply cart was pushed against the wall linen spilled onto the floor a little girl in a wheelchair grinned and pointed down the hall montana got to the bank of elevators only defined several people willing to tell her that yes a dog had gotten on she watched the light panel to see an elevator had stopped on the forest floor then jumped in next one and rode up the doors opened to the sound of screams a chair lay on it's side more linens were scattered on the floor along with a couple of charts up ahead double doors marked the entrance to the burn unit various signs explained what could and couldn't enter that part of the hospital a joyous bark told her fluffy had violated every a single posted rule not knowing what else to do montana followed the sound and pushed through the doors up ahead several nurses were trying to corral the happy dog while fluffy did her best to lick all of them at the same time when montana called her the dog turned and raced toward her just as a dog doctor walked out of a nearby room fluffy did her best to stop montana's all her puppy paws scramble as the dog tried to slow but she couldn't get traction on the floor she started to slide her but went down her front paws braced and then she was zipping along in a sitting position she plowed directly into the doctor sending him tumbling into montana the doctor was about six inches taller and a whole lot heavier than montana his shoulder hit her chest knocking the air out of her they sailed across the floor flying a few feet before stopping against the very hard floor his body slamming into hers montana lay there dazed she couldn't breathe all she felt was dead weight on top of her and a warm tongue licking her bare ankle the man got off her and knelt beside her are you hurt he demanded she shook her head then managed to gasp in air fluffy moved close author and sat down looking calm and well behaved and trick montana wasn't going to fall for the man reached for her he ran his large long fingered hands up and down her legs and arms and then felt the back of her head his touch was impersonal but it was the most action she'd had in months before she could fake you're out if she liked it she looked at his face he was the most beautiful man she'd ever seen eyes the color of green smoke fringed by dark lashes a perfect mouse with a strong jaw his cheekbone she's fine he said turning to speak with someone behind him when he shifted his head she saw the other side of his face a red scars grew from his shirt collar along the side of his neck to his left jaw and cheek they spiralled creating an angry pattern that looked painful and pulled his skin she had a feeling her shock showed but he didn't seem to notice instead he grabbed her hand and pulled her to her feet dizzy he asked curtly no she managed now that she could breathe again good he moved closer what the hell is wrong with you what kind of irresponsible idiot allows something like this to happen you should be arrested and charged with attempted murder do you know what kind of germs that dog has that you have this is a burn unit these patients are vulnerable to infection they are suffering with a level of pain you can't begin to imagine she took a step back i'm sorry she began do you think anyone here gives a damn about you being sorry you are thoughtlessness is criminal she could feel his rage in every word even more scary than what he was saying was the way he was saying it with a loud voice and a lot of energy but with a coldness that left her feeling small and stupid i didn't think he interrupted is that much,0
B002V8MLEC,it was common knowledge that he was the son of a wealthy frenchman and his beautiful african american wife and from the time dominic was born he'd had the best of everything schools social contacts and money and he'd used all three to his benefit he rotated residences between the united states dates in france although she heard he also owned a beautiful apartment in london as well as a private island off the french coast of normandy taylor picked up the brochure that had been sent to her compliments of her youngest sister cheyenne it was meant to be a joke after a conversation the two of them had shared a week ago when she told cheyenne that she wanted a baby but not a husband cheyenne had sent her the pamphlet that she'd come across in her travels as a professional model that advertised procreation vacations a week on a caribbean island plenty of dirty talk with trained professionals exotic food and aphrodisiac laden drinks and if needed in a week's supply of viagra it was advertised as a dream come true and the bahamas resort encouraged potential guests to use their facilities for a week of near constant mind blowing sex just for the purpose of making a baby the packet cheyenne had sent included several pictures bordering the brochure that could be considered x rated but they did a good job of getting their point across compared to the frosty march weather they were experiencing the island seemed like a really nice place to be right now she could spend her time resting relaxing and of course making a baby now if she could only convince the man she chooses to father her child to go along with her plan miss steele mr saxon has arrived taylor secretary's voice coming across the intercom interrupted her thoughts and immediately she took a deep breath when more heady sensations coursed through her it was time to put her plan into action please escort him in mrs roberts dominic saxon checked his watch he had just about an hour to meet with taylor steel and then he had an unexpected meeting back at the hotel he had received a call from his parents saying they were flying into d c from california and wanted to meet with him his father's voice had sounded urgent but he had refused to say what the meeting was about whenever dominic made a pitstop in the nation's capital it was usually to check on the saxon hotel just one of many his family owned in several major cities around the country usually taylor would fly into new york for their meetings so it came as a surprise when he'd gotten a call asking that he dropped by her office on this trip she had been assigned as his financial advisor when she had worked for a bank in manhattan from the very beginning the degree of her intelligence when it came to wealth management as well as her comprehensive view of his personal portfolio investment goals and financial objectives had amazed him he was already a successful businessman but together they created a long term strategy that was increasing his fortune exponentially besides being very knowledgeable on financial affairs he'd found taylor to be an extremely beautiful woman even now he could recall the desire that had consumed him the first time he'd seen her and because of it he had concluded the last he saw of his wealth and asset manager the better off he was he had decided that first day that she was definitely a woman worth taking to his bed he was one who didn't believe in mixer ing business with pleasure no matter how enticing the thought or deep the craving yet the thought had remained lodged in his mind he would be the first to admit it had been hard as hell to control the urge to take things further he was used to beautiful women but there was something about taylor steel that caused him to think of hot sex every time he was in the same room with her regardless of the ironclad control he was known for physically and emotionally he was definitely a hot blooded man which was some the thing he seemed to remember each and every time he breathed taylor sent miss steele is ready to see you mister saxon i'll escort you in he stood and smiled at her secretary a nice older lady who seemed more suited to baking cookies for her grandkids than trying to tackle the huge computer sitting in front of her thank you and i don't need an escort,0

B00KMYWM32,william james road there is a law in psychology that if you form a picture in your mind of what you would like to be and you keep and hold that picture there long enough you will soon become exactly as you have been thinking once upon a time there was a woman about thirty years old married with two children like many people she had grown up in a home where she was constantly criticized and often unfairly treated by her parents as a result she developed deep feelings of inferiority and low self esteem she was negative and fearful and had no cough didn't at all she was shy and self-effacing and did not consider herself to be particularly valuable or worthwhile she felt that she was not really talented at anything one day she was driving to the store another car went through a red light and smashed into her when she awoke she was in the hospital with a mild concussion and complete memory loss she could still speak but she had no recollection of any part of her past life she was a total amnesiac at first the doctors thought it would be temporary but weeks passed and no trace of her memory return her husband and children visit her daily but she did not know them this was such an unusual your case if other doctors and specialists came to visit her as well to test her and ask her questions about her condition starting over eventually she went home her memory a complete blank determined to understand what had happened to it she began reading medical textbooks and studying in this specialized area of amnesia and memory loss she met and spoke with specialists in this field eventually she wrote a paper on her condition not long afterwards she was invited to address a medical convention to deliver her paper ask her questions about her amnesia and share her experiences and ideas and neurological functioning during this period something amazing happened she became a new person completely all the attention in the hospital afterwards made her feel valuable important and truly loved by her family the attention and acclaim she received from members of the medical profession built her self esteem and self respect even higher she became a genuinely positive confident outgoing woman highly articulate well informed and very much in demand as a speaker and authority in the medical profession all memory of her negative childhood had been wiped out her feelings of inferiority were wiped out as well she became a new person she changed her thinking and changed her life the blank slate the scottish philosopher david hume was the first to propose the idea of the tabula rasa or blank slate this theory says that each person comes into the world with no thoughts or ideas at all and everything that a person thinks and feels is learned from infancy onward it is though the child's mind is a blur slate that every passing person and experience leaves a mark on the adult becomes the sum total of everything he or she learns feels and experiences growing up what the adult does and becomes later is the result of this early conditioning as aristotle wrote whatever is impressed is expressed perhaps the greatest breakthrough in the field of human potential in the twentieth century was the discovery of the self concept this is the idea that each person develops a bundle of beliefs regarding oneself starting at birth yourself concept then becomes the master program of your subconscious computer determine everything you think say feel and do for this reason all changing your outer life begins with a change in yourself concept with a change in the way you think and feel about yourself and your world the child is born with no self concept at all every idea opinion feeling attitude or value you have as an adult you learned from childhood everything you are today is the result of an idea or impression you took in and accepted as true when you believe something to be true it becomes true for you you whatever the fact may be as they say you are not what you think you are but what you think you are first impressions are lasting if you were raised by parents who continually told you what a good person you were who loved you and encourage you and supported you and believed in you no matter what you did or didn't do you grow up with a belief that you are a good and valuable person by the age of three this belief would lock in and become a fundamental part of the way you view yourself in relation to your world thereafter no matter what happens to you would hold to this belief it would become your reality if you are raised by parents who did not,0

B005XBYFNO,they never touched it was a habit this business of touching himself and he reminded himself again that it was a ritual not to be performed in public in complete privacy he liked the reassurance of touching all the parts of his body there was no sexual element in this even when he touched his genitals he did so with neither erotic effect nor erotic intent it was more a matter of continuing self discovery all a man had was his own self and it was as sensible to keep up a dialogue with the body as with the mind but with the body as with the mind this dialogue was a private matter cars passed and the sun warmed him and the music sang in his blood and bones the speed in his veins felt clean and strong and certain that trucker had been good to him bought him a breakfast jerk a couple of dozen bennies into his palm he'd lost the breakfast less than fifteen minutes later he'd have expected this it was greasy truck stop food and his stomach had known better than to hang onto it after throwing up he'd gone back inside for a glass of water to clean his mouth and it seemed at the time that the pills from the night before were wearing off so we got a second glass of water and washed down two of the bennies but there was still evidently some of last night's dexedrine in his system and it went with the bennies in a nice moving way and his body felt so good and his mind was so strong and he was jimmy john ho all free and white and twenty two and you couldn't ask for better than that cars in a stream staring out of blind windshields going from nowhere to nowhere except they all knew where they were going it was all built into the drivers stamped beneath the skin of their foreheads like the serial numbers on the engines of their cars imprinted there to tell them who they had to be and where they had to go and what they had to do how small they all were he had nothing but the clothes on his back and the few things in the airlines bag at his feet and the couple of dollars in his pocket and he didn't know where he was going it wasn't even sure precisely where he was and yet he was something and they were nothing nothing at all a car slowed to a stop he picked up his bag and moved to it stood while the driver leaned across to crank down the wind a balding red faced man his white shirt deeply sweat stained under the arms i said how far you go going boy the car was afford four or five years old the fenders battered one of them starting to rust out the floor in front was littered with cigarette ends and empty coffee containers the engine idling now sounded like a man with phlegm in his throat hobby and boy begone clear crossed abilene thanks he said he took a step back see i was just waiting for a friend ah there's some kind of a joke no thanks very much but i don't want to ride just now the man a salesman the guest with all those cartons in the back seat was still trying to decide how to react he couldn't just drive away he had to make sure nobody was making a fool out of him god damn he said the car and good now four years at a pace a redneck trash acting like he's used a lincolns and cadillacs never heard tell of a hitchhiker putting on the style before he paused challenging with his eyes waiting for a response and he was angered further by the lack of one his eyes narrowed turned crafty boy why you'd all want a ride after all you're just looking to get picked up by some queer you're god damn queer yourself aren't your boy he felt his hand moving of it's own accord to his back pocket he stopped the movement and managed a smile you got it he said ah i'm a queer he said you're absolutely right and still smiling he turned and walked off a ways in the opposite direction he didn't look back he kept walking waiting for the car to pull away or for the driver to get out of it and come after him the piece of pipe in his back pocket,1

B07S31JYK5,new zealand's weird business future whether you're starting a new business or are already at the helm of a fourth generation kiwi business rarity the one thing we can all agree to is the twenty first century is shaping up to be a whole lot different to the twentieth century a the stack 'em high one size fits all factory model is disappearing in front of our eyes just as a diaspora of super weird interest groups are popping up with needs and desires ready to be fulfilled by businesses like yours new zealand's weird business future people are forming groups around a shared belief or hobby they are making their obsessions now and they're doing this digitally through the groups they join the pages they like the people they follow the products they kickstart and the causes they participate in with each self selected membership they're saying hey this is me come and see what we're up to and join us if you're one of us they're easy to find you just have to look two hundred and twenty seven people are keen on thirty swing dancing lessons in oakland organize around gin mill swing club another five hundred and six bloggers make up the tome of writers and the right wellington bloggers club it's not a lot but it might just be enough for the small market you need to start net picking will help you learn the tin songs every new zealand guitar should learn on you chub and there were thirty one thousand people who are picking up what he's putting down dances need shoes bloggers need pains and guitarists need guitars and they need the ones that fit the norms of their group how weird would it be if what you solved was the norm in that group and all they bought question for what weird groups should a business be joining that change in how we arrange ourselves as a society is flowing through to how businesses address those groups and that is impacting our marketing and manufacturing and everything else in between you can fight to protect the status quo and ultimately lose or engage in the most important kiwi business revolution of our time we need more weird this isn't actually that new it turns out as kiwis have always been great at the weird and unusual and this is a good thing these weird business niches don't tend to be big enough to feed the appetite of the global multinationals why would they chase millions when their shareholders demand profits on billions al weirdness has lead to greatness before lord rutherford embraced his weirdness by searching for the invisible disintegration of chemical elements which led him to discover that radioactivity had a half-life from there things got even weirder as he managed to see split an atom in nineteen seventeen in a nuclear reaction between nitrogen and alpha particles in which he also discovered the proton what that's super weird so much so we celebrate his achievement on our biggest noted bill the one hundred dollar note every time you see one of those dollar bills in your business remember it was celebrating the weirdness that got him off the kiwi farm and into the science lab coat of discovery one hundred years later team new zealand swapped out the old arm powered winches on their boat for cycle style grinders because of course leg muscles beat arm muscles so obvious when you think about it yet in the history of the race twenty seventeen was the first time cycling at sea was introduced totally weird the weirdness of watching world class athletes pedal their way to victory beating the united states on a boat in bermuda i believe is a metaphor that says that our nation is ready to go big on creativity a that relies on weirdness to solve existing problems in entirely new ways,0

B004WLH9L6,it'd be press my present publishers in nineteen ninety seven and ninety ninety eight i returned to london twice for the purposes of my researches broadened and deepened by reading in a large variety of archives and private papers haven't sua fought oddly belly this is the story of the present book thus it may be said that this book amounts to the completion of a very lopsided trilogy from three pages in the last european war to fifteen pages in the dual and then to about two hundred pages in this one or from macro cosmic to micro cosmic history of a sort a friend said the other day in mock seriousness will your next book be three hours in london no it won't i must now add a caveat to this is that not only the scope but the structures of the above mentioned books are very different a somewhat uncategorized ubl historian i am not a specialist in british political or social or military history however one consideration may end shrewd here during the past fifteen or twenty years british historians have written valuable articles and books dealing with churchill and halifax and the politics of war parts of which include those five days in may nineteen forty at the risk of presumption i shall venture to say that i have had one advantage over many of them this has been my knowledge about hitler or rather my familiarity with documents and other materials relating to him in this case especially in nineteen forty four without understanding what hitler said and thought and how close he came to winning the war in may nineteen forty that secondary duel between churchill and halifax in the war cabinet seems less important a flicker of doubt perhaps a conflict between two personalities a footnote in the political history of modern britain there were and are reasons to look at and treat the five days in london in may nineteen forty in that way such treatments are not necessarily the results of narrow mindedness or excessive specialization tightly focused views are often useful while there is a kind of broad mindedness that can be flat in this book however i have attempted to combine the narrowing acuity of a specialist with a broader perspective aware that perspective is a component of reality itself in some that during those five days in london the danger not only to britain but to the world was greater and deeper than most people still think chapter one the hinge of fate this book attempts to reconstruct the history of five days that could have changed the world the setting is london and the five days are friday through tuesday the twenty fourth to the twenty eighth of may nineteen forty then and there adolf hitler came closest to winning the second world war his war one man who knew how close hitler had come to his ultimate victory was winston churchill in the years after the war he gave the title the hinge of fate to the fourth volume of his war memoirs that volume dealt with the year nineteen forty two near the end of which the germans were turned back on many fronts in november nineteen forty two he said to the british people that this was not yet the beginning of the end but perhaps the end of the beginning november nineteen forty two was the military hinge of fate on the battlefields of egypt north africa and russia the military turning points even then britain couldn't win the war in the end america and russia did but in may nineteen forty churchill was as the one who didn't lose it then and there he saved britain and europe and western civilization and about that hinge of fate his war memoirs essentially his history of the second world war are largely silent in the history of states and of peoples a turning point is often a battle or an episode during a revolution more precisely a sudden shifting of events,0
B00CPQP58E,yes when you come into north carolina emily prodded you have to have another dress fitting not that you ever gain an ounce it's more of a show of solidarity with gabby who still fighting baby weight and there's the bridal shower grandmother and gabby are throwing then the rehearsal dinner i'm thinking we need a bachelorette night just us girls i want you ha ear for every minute this is going to be the absolute best summer the castle sisters have ever had and sandcastle bay i wouldn't miss any of it samantha assured her after all wasn't either one who predicted last august that you and boone were going to get back together yes you demonstrated amazing inside but it wouldn't be the first time that some irresistible part came through at the last second and you bailed on me my college graduation comes to mind well there's no way i'd bail on your wedding samantha reassured her the likelihood of a plum role being offered was abysmally small besides she'd never let emily down after promising to be her maid of honor honor the fact that emily had even asked had come as a surprise their relationship had been tainted by some kind of sibling rivalry she'd never understood but her sisters seemed to be sincerely trying to leave that in the past i'm driving south the day after tomorrow she told emily not mentioning that the wedding was providing the perfect ix excuse to leave new york behind during these depressing dog days of summer i'll be there to do whatever you need are you bringing what's his face with you the guy from the network or the producer i lose track truthfully so do i samantha admitted there is no one i'd want around for an occasion as important as my little sister's wedding there was a faint hesitation on the other end of the line and then emily asked slyly not even ethan cole samantha's heart did a predictable little stutter step why on earth would you bring up ethan he's ancient history not even history come to think of it he never even knew i existed back in the day aha emily said triumphantly you do still have feelings for him i told gabby you did she thinks so too our powers of observation are every bit as good as yours when it comes to romance and you got that from my asking why you mentioned him samantha inquired irritably hating any possibility that at her age she he could be wearing her heart on her sleeve or anyone to detect especially when the man in question probably wouldn't even recognize her if their paths crossed i got that from your wearing his old football jersey around the house the whole time you were home after the hurricane last summer emily responded and amazingly it disappeared after you went back to new york i'll bet it's in your closet up there right this minute and is not samantha retorted glancing down at the golden green jersey she was currently wearing so what if she still harbored a not so secret crush on the star quarterback from the high school three years older and surrounded by throngs of local girls ethan had never won i noticed her back then she was a summer kid not even a blip on his radar she seriously doubted he discovered deep feelings in the intervening years just from spotting her in some detergent commercial and that was even assuming he knew it was her and you know he never married emily said casually and he and boom play golf together boons asked him to be in the wedding samantha is stupid hard did another of those annoying little tell tell hop skip and jumps not on my account i hope of course not emily said but he is boone's best man which means you'll be seeing a lot of him samantha ground she'd expect did this sort of matchmaking from her grandmother who'd actively campaigned to see that emily and boone were reunited and had done her share of manipulating to see that gabby wound up with wade johnson samantha had been certain though that cora jane would show a little more respect for samantha his ability to find her own man then again there wasn't much effort once that samantha had made any particularly good choices up to now the men she dated had been seriously lacking and staying power did grandmother put you up to this she asked testily up to what emily replied innocently i told you boone any then have been friends forever their families go way back it makes perfect sense that he'd want ethan in the wedding i suppose samantha conceded got iran i love you emily said see you soon see you soon samantha echoed suddenly going back to sand castle bay for her sister's wedding had gotten a lot more interesting and maybe just a little dangerous gabby held daniela jane and her arms rocking her gently as she studied the color in emily's cheeks well did you find out whatever it was he wanted to know when you spoke to samantha she asked samantha still has a bad reason,0

B071S88ZRF,in most organizations sales drives revenue and marketing drives lead generation and awareness marketing looks at win rates and conversion rates across the sales funnel takes the revenue target for the next quarter and calculates how many leads are required for sales to hit their number so sales uses the leads and content that marketing gives them and tries to close as many sales as possible the two departments are inherently different from how they are compensated to how they are educated and that's good but it can also make it hard for sales and marketing to work together that two teams have frequently adorns over issues as small as how to score an individual lead or as large as which markets to target that results in mistrust avoidance and outright hostility between the groups some of which is even enabled by misguided ceos get it right too take those first steps toward alignment christelle through has been a pioneer in using data to bridge marketing and sales in her senior level roles at mappa technologies jibe software ma kettle to leo and aretha christelle his most recent role was to sit between sales and marketing ing and use data to bring them into alignment what it takes according to chris dal is working together and relying on data to build agreement in a previous company i discovered early on the job but our lead scoring wasn't effective christelle explained marketing thought we were doing great big because we were delivering leads that scored well but sales complained the leads were junk it took us a while to figure out how to do it right so we weren't delivering twenty thousand marginal leads we were delivering three thousand good ones it was more than just a revamp of the lead scoring methodology instead it star at a deeper conversation between marketing and sales to discover what was really important we walked the sales team to our scoring methodology and discussed each and every point christelle continued what firmer graphic information is important should a trade show lead get more points no shadows white paper download get more points may be walking to the logic helps to flesh out the thought behind it and make it transparent it really built trust between the teams as they figured out the appropriate lead scoring models it led to more conversations and more collaboration on different items all of which she brought the teams closer to alignment eventually we talked instead of getting angry at each other she continued marketing can ask for more budget to get more leads to help sales meet their number or we can jointly figure out how to increase close rates so sales can hire more reps we ended up being a joint team figuring out how to meet the overall goals together not getting angry at each other doesn't mean not having disagreements however christ also relies on data as the key to finding a solution and avoiding lingering issues if you're upset you tend to make blanket statements like we don't have any leads she added when we rely on data we can turn it into a fact based conversation we can both see exactly what's happening data takes the emotion out of it it keeps you from getting defensive especially if you approach it by saying let's both sit down and look at the data it also helps you figure out what the true issues are and points you in the right direction to fix them here's what we've seen and why we're devoted to changing it we've each been in leadership roles for more than twenty years and we've seen our share of aligned and misaligned sales and marketing teams we've worked under ceos who understand the value of alignment and build a culture that fosters communication and collaboration and we've worked on the ceos who encourage hostility bitch between the teams thinking that more tension yields better performance we've also each worked with good and bad counterparts and we've learned what alignment takes commitment and work from both teams especially their leadership tracy experienced blatant mis alignment first hand when as a newly hired svp of marketing she was introduced to her executive sales counterparts and they wouldn't even shake her hand their behavior was rude obviously but after watching a revolving door of marketing leaders come and go the reasoning was sound you won't be around long so why bother getting to know you andrea as vp of sales reached her miss alignment breaking point while working with a counterpoint in,0

B00B5FS0VK,chapter one and how is my beautiful style holding up anthea kane froze as marshall bran jostled in beside her at the crowded bar his strong aftershave engulfing her and an invisible cloud of eye watering fumes blinking she fought the urge to shy away when he placed a hand on her lower back as the producer of the three movies she'd started and and thea refused to let marshall's sleazy news get in the way of their professional relationship tonight she wanted to bask in the glow of success not deal with his oily commands avoiding eye contact she glanced around the crowded cinema foyer ten minutes earlier the vip guests had watched her star as alex stark in the australian premiere of a kick to the heart a kick to the head the first film in the action parody franchise had done great box office business as had the sequel a kick to the guts how successful this third and final installment would prove to be was anyone's guess thinking about all three ridiculous titles brought an embarrassed flush to her cheeks although grateful to the kick movies for shooting her to instant fame what she wanted more than anything was a serious meaty role something more than alex stark's cold assassin could offer something with meaning marshall brands clammy fingers drifted down her back eager to escape the unwanted attention she leaned in close to be heard over the crowd would you excuse me don't tell me you're leaving already he said moving in even closer i just need to use the little girls' room mm marshall's eyes brightened no doubt believing she wanted to freshen up for him right by all means he said and gave her a wink that made her skin crawl was it any wonder she no longer dated after the success of the first cake movie she soon discovered men only wanted one thing to bed her screen persona alex stark no one seemed interested in getting to know anthea kane and so had begun the habit of accompanying her brother ethan and who also acted as her manager to these events with the hope of warding off any unwanted advances she squeezed through the throng of producers studio executives and agents and scan the crowd for ethan as usual he'd managed to disappear when she needed him most though how could she blame him being seen with his little sister probably didn't do much for him in the dating department safely ensconced in a lady stall and the fished her cell phone from her purse with the intention of asking ethan's help in escaping marshall brand she navigated to the contact screen just as she was about to press the dial button two sets of stilettos clicked across the bathroom tiles a high pitched woman's voice said that was even more absurd than the second one and the frowned as their stall doors banged shut a deeper female voice responded marshall intends to screw her tonight if you ask me she better leap at the chance after the dismal perform moments we just witness no one in their right mind would ever hire her again and the his mouth dropped open not because of marshal brand's intentions which came as no surprise but because of the brutal critique of her performance i agree said the high pitched voice but relay me marshall shouldn't waste his time with an absolute d grade like hair both women chuckled as their toilets flushed,0
B002V5CMLM,her companion mister long once again with ambien left his home returned to the hotel bel-air and sought out the suite of mister eagle you have heard as she entered the suite next door in error and shot mr and mrs thomas the tiller of new york believing that they were mr eagle and his friend all of this is in evidence and the weight of it is enough for you to send ms eagle to prison for the rest of her life i ask you to do just that thank you valerie simmons sat down the judge turned to the defense table mr karp he said richard karp rows and face the jury good morning he said ladies and gentlemen this case is about reasonable doubt if you believe that there is a reasonable doubt that barbara eagle killed mr and mrs de tiller and that is all that she is charged with then you are legally and morally bound to a quitter everything you have heard heard from the prosecution about ms eagle's past and what she may or may not have done in mexico is window dressing nothing more and none of what you have heard is supported by any material evidence just the testimony of questionable witnesses while you heard mr ego testify that he was drugged with ambien there is no scientific evidence to support that contention what happened was that mr eagle had too much to drink the evening before and overslept the funds that ms eagle took with her to mexico in a desperate attempt to remove herself from an abusive marriage were marital funds and she was legally entitled to take them i would remind you that one of the two men allegedly hired to kill mystery girl is dead and the other could not pick ms yg oil out of a lineup i would remind you that it is not a crime in the united states to shoot someone in mexico in self defense or to push someone off a boat in an attempt to defend herself from a rape and you have heard that both of her attackers survived i would remind you that although ms eagle and mr long dined at the bel air the evening before the murder you have also heard from mr long that she spent the entire night in his bed in his home and did not return to the bel air to shoot mr de taylor who you have heard was the son of a mafia kingpin car minded taylor who also met a violent death it is far more likely that thomas did tiller was killed by his own associates or competitors than by ms eagle i would remind you that mr james long underwent no testing for the drug ambien and he has testified that ms eagle spent the night with him indeed that they made love in the middle of the night i would remind you that it is not a crime for a woman to have her appearance enhanced by her hair stylist and her cosmetic surgeon he smiled knowingly in fact stripped to it's relevant essentials the prosecution's case is nothing more than a lot of hot air backed only by the testimony of an angry ex husband and the two private detectives he hired to bully and harass her and i come into this court and lie about her there is no physical evidence no murder weapon and no motive for the murders of two people ms eagle had never even met i put it to you that the doubt of guilt in this case is not only reasonable but overwhelming and i ask you after a careful examination the evidence or rather non evidence to acquit barbara eagle and set her free so that she may still have a chance to find some happiness in what has so far been a life full of abuse and harassment by her ex husband and others find her not guilty carp sat down what do you think susanna asked well they both said pretty much what i would have served if i had been prosecuting or defending eagle said i think the jury will convict her well then susannah said while the jury is deliberating may i distract you you may eagle said rolling over and taking her in his arms she had been distracting him for ten minutes or so when eagle was re distracted by his sudden intensity in the voice of the court,1
B002V1NKGC,what am i going to do happy heard her own voice high restless uneven and shrill her mouth curved down for lorne as a sad faced clown she stared in the mirror and spoke again now happy no more of this there she sounded better sounded like herself a soft voice sweet as summer berries appealing but the change in pitch didn't solve anything didn't show her any way out of the cloud of discord that was going to surround all of them as surely as the december fog curled and edit around the house swirled over the marsh throughout her life she'd made it a point to avoid unpleasantness but this time marguerite of course left trouble trailing behind her she always had and always would daddy had called marguerite scarlet because every place that scarlett o'hara went trouble followed but he had nicknamed her his other daughter the child of his late middle age miss happy-go-lucky saying that when she breezed into a room she made everybody happy and she had hadn't she even though the laughter in later years seemed too often to turn to tears but that was when she moved on happy go lucky determined to be carefree because that's who she was tears filmed happy's blue eyes eyes that so long ago had mastered the art of beguile mint eyes that had made a lifelong practice of never seeing anything they didn't want to see for an instant her protective mental mental parted just long enough to wonder how it might have been different what if daddy had called marguerite lionheart would marguerite have envisioned herself as courageous and undaunted devoted to her followers rather than beleaguered and alone what if instead of happy go lucky her own nickname had been made marion would she have been stalwart and steady happy she'd always tried to be happy but how could she be happy when it seemed obvious that everyone in the family was destined to quarrel as soon as the others learned of margaret's mad plan tempers would erupt the atmosphere was already tense scholarly wayne who usually kept his nose in a book and he study door shut had taken to walking about the grounds staring up at the house a house he had always refused to leave self-effacing alice who'd put up with marguerite through a lifetime of tempests was increasingly somber the others would arrive today platinum haired donna who loved objects more than people bluff and hearty terry who swaggered and always needed money and hapless joan who'd never really gotten over her divorce from wayne even her own spunky rachel was being difficult flipping her dark hair glaring at happy with rebellious eyes,1
B07Q6ZZQ4Q,fiji the french host with tactics refined over years of battling with the scots it was a shock to the whole of europe it shouldn't have been such a surprise though the british had a small but experienced army which was used to fighting on foot just as the men of morgan had been and those at the battle of the golden spurs at cu trey at both battles groups of supposedly ignorant and incompetent peasants had destroyed more powerful french armies but in thirteen twenty five the conflict the truth and the negotiations between the english and the french were crucial to the whole period not only because they were to set the stamp on the subsequent suspicion and dislike that existed between english and french in the run up to the hundred years war which itself polluted relations b between the two countries right up until the franco prussian wars of the later eighteen hundreds but because at the time this difficult and protracted parley itself helped mortimer and isabella plot their invasion and gave them a ready source of supporters the british had been exiled under the reign of the deplorable despair answer so i'm afraid for a baldwin and simon the long suffering companions have been thrust into the limelight for this story they have been cast into france for their sins and now must live perilously amid the great forces at work to start afresh war some may be surprised by the account of the troubles of the unfortunate lady blush once princess bride to the man who was to become charles the fourth sadly the story is all true the affair of the silken purses has been covered in another book so i shall not go into detail here suffice to say the two royal princesses were shown to be carrying an adulterous affairs with a pair of brothers the men were killed rather horribly and the women locked up in thirteen fourteen marguerite the elder of the two was thought to be more responsible and was thrown into a freezing sat in the chateau gaya she survived a short while but the cold and poor diet put paid to her in a matter of months the second was blush wife of charles she too was thrown into a dungeon at the chateau it is said that she was made pregnant by her jailer and gave birth to a child in thirteen twenty three a little while before that while she was pregnant her marriage had at last been annulled and in thirteen twenty five i think the sources grub a little vague the precise details she was allowed to move to the convent abbey of moby song here she survived only one more year dying perhaps because of the damage down to her constitution over the previous eleven years of incarceration so was her jailer her enthusiastic lover did she welcomed the attentions of any man no matter how lowly or was that a plot set in train by the french king or his courtiers to have her proved adulterous so that the pope would be forced to allow the marriage could someone else have had a similar desire to see the marriage annulled i do not know the truth however it is all too easy to sit in judgment after some seven hundred years and take the twenty first century review what would it be well first that it was shocking that these two women should have been so appallingly treated for their sexual misdemeanors second that clearly the poor woman in the cell would never have courted the attentions of a mere castle jailer and yet these people lived in a different era the two princesses were guilty not merely of betraying their own husbands that was unforgivable enough that they had committed a vastly worse crime they had risked the bloodline of the kings of france so heinous was their offense that it may have helped kill off the reigning king philip the fourth them because of the women's behavior that existing children had to be rejected by their fathers presuming of course that the princes involved were the genetic fathers which was the concern and doubt by a sad twist of fate the princess concerned all proved to be short lived by thirteen twenty eight all had died and there were no male heirs the capacious line had died out this led to the election of the first of the valois kings of france which itself contributed to the hundred years war because the english had a claim to the french throne through isabella however the french refused to consider,1

B087WF1KCV,the curb and start the dehydrator the plan was to prepare most of my food in advance and buy things to supplement along the way each morning i cooked a full batch of dehydrated bowl food such as spaghetti or a bean concoction and placed it in the dehydrator for eight to twelve hours after the water had been sucked out i packaged it in meal sized flat stick bags beans and noodles would be the staples of my diet they were cheap and calorie dense they also only required adding boiling water to turn into a meal it quickly became obvious staying within my budget would be difficult having the right gear to hike through all four seasons was essential but expensive thus the pursuit of gear sponsorships and discounts began i reached out to various companies hoping something would stick it was overwhelming but i was inspired each gear company asked the same question why have we never heard of you when i didn't have a good answer the hopes of sponsorship ended all i needed was a little help with the necessary gear i i worked early mornings and late evenings tackling a never ending to do list training and sleep suffered but my desire never faltered finally on a cold denver day i caught my break a small southwestern gear company spoke the words i had been waiting for what address can we send this to i spat out the address and delighted in some one else believing i had a chance after my last day of work i loaded up the car and drove twenty three hours back to my home town vancouver washington it was time to create a home base a support center to aid through the trials and tribulations of an eight thousand mile adventure in my parents' house i set up my gear and food there is much to do much to learn and much to organize i had only a very short time to understand my first two thousand one hundred eighty nine miles the appalachian trail the dream was becoming real i would soon be hiking north from georgia to maine on the longest hiking only footpath in the world packing was an endeavor i was days away from entering the wilderness with only what was in my pack the terrain and conditions were unknown each resupply store and location was a mystery i packed repacked and finally unpacked clothes were in one pile gear and another and miscellaneous items and yet another overwhelmed i gave up and moved on to something i knew better food priority one resupply boxes i drove to every post office within a few miles and picked up medium and large flat rate boxes after constructing them i opened my fresh never touched appalachian trail guidebook ideally hikers plan for a single thru hike over months even years a thru hike is an attempt at hiking an entire lot long trail in one push i devoured the guidebook planning resupply as surveying elevations of becoming familiar with the east coast i would carry three to five days of food at a time mailing boxes of it to towns along the way after each box is filled and labeled it was set in the finished stack once a thousand miles of boxes were prepared i reluctantly returned to filling my backpack the floor was a disorganized mess there were clothes sleeping bags food items supplies cooking gear and an unbelievable pile of miscellaneous items some things were new and some were well worn with years of use what would i wear what would i carry endless questions dominated my mind and i tried to rely on my previous two thru hikes for answers i had never hiked in the winter the balance of staying warm but also keeping my pack light was a major obstacle luckily the east coast is densely populated and full of hostels lodges hotels and resorts i would rely on these connections to civilization to re supply change out gear and seek refuge along the way they would be my safety net while i learned the ropes of winter backpacking i packed to stay warm down to zero degrees gear to protect me through prolonged rain and items necessary to stay alive the appalachian trail has shelters nearly every ten miles over it's two thousand one hundred eight eighty nine mile length the shelters vary greatly in quality and size but are often little more than covered shacks infested with mice snakes insects and even bears i hope the vermin will be less active in the winter months considering this optimism i plan to use shelters as often as possible relying on shelters would cut down my pack weight i plan to carry only a light tarp as opposed to attend the tarp would provide minimal protection against the elements but the great benefit was nearly the pound and weight it saved utilizing shelters had two more advantages i would stay warm by setting up my tarp inside the shelter to hold heaton and i would be able to hike longer with camp already partially constructed in a practice run during a pacific northwest rainstorm i set up my tarp in the yard and failed miserably the sides quickly collapsed under the falling precipitation instead of tackling the problem head on and finding a solution i quit,0

B00BW6TDOU,i was with the a company men in the front line on the east side next to the branch in first battalion headquarters b and c company men were stolen the manoir and hill positions all of us waited alone with our thoughts since oh eight hundred hours the mortars and heavy artillery had intel fine including the horrifying tree bursts we were in our foxholes but of necessity craning our necks looking out for the enemy approach we were all thinking one though is today the day that i get it wet and shivering from the moist ocean and marsh air we were dirty thirsty and hungry we had no water our throats were very dry and rk russians were all expended on top of all of these debilitating factors more germans were attacking that our meager stockpile of ammunition could conceivably handle unless you've faced the grim reaper in the form of an oncoming enemy it is hardly possible to understand the fear and dread that runs through the mind of a frontline infantry men you pray you have the fear of death on your mind you're watching armed men and tanks coming at you artillery and mortar explosions and shrapnel are flying through the air all around you there is no thought in your mind to get out of your hole and run because you know you would be cut down by rifle or shrapnel fragments that cheered as an end or leave you until you get a chance to open fire with your weapon directly at the enemy and in our case case an enemy who was no more than forty yards in front of us the only thought on your mind becomes citing the enemy soldier and getting off two or three rounds until he falls then get another few rounds off there are plenty of targets you have no fear of death now it is gone completely it is surprising but while sighting and shooting you are oblivious to the mortar and artillery bursts surround you during the german attack one piece of shrapnel hit the very rear part of my helmet and pushed my head forward into the dirt fortunately i had my helmet pushed way back to get my eye right down on the side of my grand rifle the crowds were lobbing in mortars on the first and second platoons above the riverbanks the one five or five men about fifty five yards to the rear were still getting hit with artillery it seemed to be payback time indeed for the pasting the first battalion five or five our seat t had given jerry the day before,0
B00OAOJPHQ,voice that i'd set up as a diversion the device was basically a black powder charge designed to give off a big enough band to grab lunch detention but not to kill anyone there will be some damage that'd be the odd cut or bruise but there shouldn't be any fatalities the shaving cream shop was there because i didn't want a designated by accident the pressel on the rights was exposed this was the one that would initiate the shoot next to the box i had a set of binaries mounted on a mini tripod and trained on the killing ground i was going to need them to watch the yes man as he moved about the crowd and id the target the lunchbox contained a big green square lithium battery and a massive wires and circuit boards i'd never tried to make things look neat i just wanted them to work two purple plastic coated wire antennas stuck out of the rear of the box trailed along the desk over the window sill i'd pushed up against then dangled down the outside wall the window closed down on them to cut out as much noise as possible the loudest sound in the room was my breathing which started to quicken as the witching hour got closer it was only outdone by the occasional scream of delight from a tourist at ground level or a particularly loud pa system from the river all i could do was white i crossed my arms on the desk rested my head on them and stared at the bulbs that were now level with my eyes willing them to start flashing i was shaken out of my trance as big ben struck too i knew the snipers wouldn't move into their fire positions until the last moment so that they didn't expose themselves longer than necessary but i really wanted those lights to stop flashing at me for about the millionth time in the past twenty minutes i pushed down on the uncovered pressel resting the side of my head on my forearm to look inside the box like a kid wondering what his mom had made him for lunch a small bulb nestled amongst the massive was lit up with the current generated by my scent pressel i wish now that i'd burnt another hole in the lid for the bulb inside to join the others but at the time i couldn't be asked i released it and pressed again the same thing happened the device was working but what about the other three that are built for the snipers i just have to wait and see the other thing i did for the millionth time was wonder why i couldn't just say no to this stuff apart from the fact i was soft in the head the answer was the same as always it was the only thing i knew i knew it the firm knew it they also knew that as always i was desperate for cash again if i was truthful with myself which i found very hard there was another much deeper reason i got my eyes level with the bulbs once more and took a deep breath but learned a few things into attending the clinic with kelly even at school there was desperation in me to be part of something whether it was joining a woodwork group or a gang that used to rub the jewish kids of the dinner money they'd wrapped in hankies so we couldn't hear it rattle in their pockets as they walked past but it never worked that feeling of belonging only happened once i joined the army and now i just couldn't seem to shake it off at last the metal bulb sniper tos gave five deliberate one second pulses i put my thumb on the sand pretzel and after a nanosecond to check i wasn't about to blow up london in my excitement i depressed it three times in exactly the same rhythm to say that i had received the signal checking each time that the white circuit test bulb inside the box lit up i got three flashes back immediately from the middle bulb good news sniper two was in position ready to fire and we had combs all i needed now was one and three and i'd be cooking with gas i'd put everything they snipe as needed to know where to be how to get there what to do once in position and more importantly for them how to get away afterwards with the weapons and equipment in their individual deal bs that letterboxes all they had to do was read the orders check the kit and get on with the shoot the three at different five positions each unknown to the others none of them had met or even seen each other and they hadn't met me that's how these things are done opsec operational security you only know what you need to i had an extremely busy ten nights of city ours close target records,1
B07F71SHXH,prologue the tears were gone now and no longer blinded the young man's vision even so he really didn't see the road in front of him the laser headlights of the expensive sports car easily illuminated six hundred yards ahead but nothing they showed registered in his mind and his view was blocked by any physical barrier but rather a mental one there was no room in his consciousness for the image of the world outside of his windshield his mind was too filled with grief except for the excessive speed the vehicle appeared to be under complete control no sign from it's motion showed that the driver was operating while almost completely oblivious to what lay in his path the driver though youthful was skilled with hundreds of hours behind the wheel of high high performance vehicles even without intelligent direction his body merged into the familiar role of piloting the car staying on the road and avoiding obstacles his actions are only now under the direction of what one might optimistically refer to as a plan he had regained consciousness only the morning before and awakened to unbearable grief his first emotional movement had been a staggering attempted retreat but there was no escape his world was now filled only with pain and loss and he was deprived of the pillar of strength to which he had always clung he was moving well over one hundred miles per hour and on a beeline course to his objective straight through the heart of the city this was a course of action doomed to failure with returning awareness he slowed his speed and changed his course to take him on a circular path around the city to his destination he had to avoid disaster he was less concerned with a fiery crash than being stopped by a police officer at this point death didn't seem as horrible as having to go on with no hope and hope would certainly be lost if a police officer were to pull him over and discover the lifeless body of the beautiful a young woman in the passenger seat chapter one i am suddenly aware that i've been awake for awhile not long certainly no more than a minute probably only a few seconds i keep my eyes closed not wanting to leave the darkness i can see enough light coming through my closed eyelids to know the room will be bright i'm just not ready for that yet when i wake from normal sleep i usually hear the echoes of rem sleep vague and fading memories of conversation and the impression that i was with other people will slowly disappear like mr another world will fade as i come more fully into this one but this is different this isn't the transition from one form of awareness to another it's nothing at all like leaving a dream for the first few seconds before memory comes online it's like suddenly coming into existence a personal big bang where i erupt from nothingness nothing much followed this personal creation on my first awakening but that was several cycles ago this awakening is different from that first one i have learned much and now have a history shortly after becoming aware of awareness i i start to be aware of that history i know my name now i know who i am oh kz it's time to open those pretty greens i know who that is too that will be sack sack always refers to my eyes as pretty greens it's true about my eyes they are green and very pretty and almost startling emerald set in the golden amber of flawless skin my eyelids will have a similar shimmering tint set behind full luxuriant lashes that are slightly longer toward the outside giving my eyes a slight almond shape the lashes are the same dark cocoa color of my eyebrows between my wife set eyes is the narrow bridge of my nose which runs to the tip with a slight upturn in a continuous curve,1
B01639BCHG,somewhere around three o'clock that morning i was jolted out of a deep sleep by a metal object being pounded on my metal door i jumped to my feet and stood frozen a sick yay you're feeling taking hold yeah we buy to say someone yelled open up slowly i crept to the front wall and peered through the tiny crack that served as a peephole in the moonlight i could make out for men in ski masks my heart skipped a beat i was in trouble but to say we know you're in there open this door now i was trapped in this one room defenseless only the one door there wasn't much choice but to deal with the matter here and now hold on i finally called out unchanging and unlocking the door with shaking hands i pulled it open and stood there in cut offs and bare chest trying to look unfazed what's wrong what are you doing here demanded the guy in front of me his voice was that of a teenager but it has a cocky superiority of a militia man you are trespassing this is not your place another man barked whereas octavio he's not around i'm a friend and he's letting me stay here his letting you stay here parroted the cocky one maybe so but you have not paid this month maintenance fee so you are trespassing oh no i assured them of w is my policy he's not charging me any lucas a cocky one turned and mumbled something i didn't catch but it made the others laugh mercilessly now i saw that the big mouth had a heavy caliber pistol in a shoulder holster your name he snapped my name is either i said trying to sound calm but not succeeding editor i do not like to repeat myself but for your benefit editor as a gesture of goodwill i tell you again you have not paid this month maintenance fee but okt you said i don't have to pay to live here i protested he shook his head battersea you are maybe one bogey to slow in the head i don't think so perhaps i am not making myself clear you don't pay your maintenance fee to live here you pay for our protection and dennis one who had not spoken an older man now stepped forward and seemed to take charge saturday know there are many bad people about something could happen to you should you not have our protection you don't want anything to happen to you do you i opened my mouth and the words fell out no i don't want that see you are frightened already at the very thought the older one pointed out but there is no need it is a simple thing we ask pay our fee and you will be protected and then this you have my personal guarantee but i have very little money i told them that's why i w lets me stay here i only earn enough to eat and ride the bus i'm always broke the older man in the ski mask was wagging his finger at me no no no this is not good to say no money of course you have money will show you he jerked his head toward the doorway the two silent men pushed me aside and went in with flashlight i have no valuables either i said but they weren't listening the men went straight for my two suitcases and opened them they toss everything out on the dirt floor and rummaged through my clothes and paperback books they took a yankees baseball cap my dad had given me a couple of the books and my only pair of good genes as they were collecting the loot one of them spotted my casio watch on the orange crate chair rated the older man snap his fingers and was handed the watch he held it under a flashlight and played with the buttons a few moments then grinned hideously in the mouth hole of the ski mask a single gold tooth reflecting in the light you see saturday know you do have the payment this will cover you maintenance fee for a whole month he stopped grinning and the gold tooth disappeared for a month he repeated he pocketed the watch and they all departed quickly moving off into the night like a pack of guessed the rodents,0
B00BOSEISC,miss withers had little use for the cloakroom since she kept her own neat sailor in a drawer on her desk and one b and since her nose had not been powdered since the taft administration she opened the door quickly but did not switch on the light as she did not want everybody in the street to see her running to the window to look after or another teacher she was familiar enough with the room though it was in half darkness on one side where the chairs and the lounge and on the other the coat lockers and the door of the laboratory the frosted window was a dull blur of light across the room with eight inches of daylight at the bottom where it was open for the sake of air then her foot struck something soft on the floor she stooped and picked up a woman's shoe it was a gay ridiculous bit of footwear truly a sandal instead of a shoe it consisted only of a tapering heal a thin sole and four or five five straps only a nice halloran wore shoes like that and a nice halloran had gone home five minutes ago had she left her shoes here miss withers stood up went back to the door and turned on the light on the floor lay the mate to the shoe she held in her hand and on couch was what was left of a nice halloran,1
B01N3YYXC0,he probably would have walked right past them and gone on stage with the pickup band he hired when he rolled into town i hear phil spector who did all those great records in the fifties and early sixties fills voices scary always challenging me always reminding me that he came first wilson i hear him saying in my head you're never going to top you've lost that loving feeling or be my baby so don't even try but maybe he wants me to try nothing is ever simple with him now when he's in my head simple as in what he's about people say that we named pet sounds partly as a tribute to him check the initials i also hear my dad in my head his voice is louder than the others what's the matter buddy you got any guts is this all about you why so many musicians rock and roll his two guitars bass and drums any more than that is just about ego when i hear those voices i try to shut them out i'm just trying to get a feel for the room and how the songs will come alive inside of it i'm also trying to get a feel for where i fit into all of this back in the old days with the boys i never liked going on stage people used to write about how i seemed stiff then they started writing about how i had stage fright it's a weird phrase stage fright i wasn't afraid of the stage i was afraid of all the eyes watching me and of the lights and have the chance that i might disappoint everyone there are so many expectations that i could figure out in the studio but they were different on stage a good audience is like a wave that you can ride on top of it's a great feeling but a crowd can also feel the other way round like a wave that's on top of you there are other voices too along with chuck berry and phil spector and my dad the other voices or worse they're saying horrible things about my music your music is no damn good brian get to work brian you're falling behind brian sometimes they just skip the music and go right for me we're coming for you brian this is the end brian we are going to kill you brian there are bits and pieces of the rest of the people i think about the rest of the people i hear that don't sound like anyone i know not exactly except that i know them all too well i have heard them since i was in my early twenties i've heard them many days and when i haven't heard them i have worried about hearing them my whole life i've tried to figure out how to deal with them i've tried to ignore them that didn't work i've tried to chase them away with drinking and drugs that didn't work i have been fed all kinds of medication and when was the wrong kind which was often that didn't work i've had all all kinds of therapy some of it was terrible and almost did me in some of it was beautiful and made me stronger in the end i have had to learn to live with them do you know what that's like to struggle with that every single day of your life i hope not but many people do or know someone who does everyone who knows me know someone who does so many people on the planet deal with some type of mental illness i've learned that over the years and it makes me feel less lonely it's part of my life there's no way around it my story is a music story and family story and a love story but it's a story of mental illness too london is part of that story i've often said that this city is my spiritual home london audiences really appreciate my music the smile show is part of that story it's a way of bringing something back that looked like it would stay in the past to calm myself i try to meditate my way into the muse basic music is the solution music takes what's inside me and puts it into the world around me it's my way of showing people things i can't show any other way music is in my soul i wrote that once and it's one of the best lyrics i ever wrote i remember what i was thinking about the past resurrecting smile is both past and present when we didn't finish the album a part of me was unfinished also you know can you imagine leaving your masterpiece locked up in a drawer for almost forty years that drawer was opened slowly that came open a little bit at a christmas party at scott bennett's house where i played heroes and villains on the piano and then a little more when david leave told me to play it at a tribute show,0
B07QHWXX6R,it's been thirteen months since i received the phone call a detached voice on the other end telling me that my father had died in an unfortunate occupational accident thirteen months since i sat in leith hamptons toronto law office for the reading of my father's well thirteen ma months since i found out that i calamity barnstable answers to cali had inherited a house and market bell it was a house i didn't know existed in a commuter town better suited to families with two kids a cat and a collie than a thirty six year old single female who thrived on on the anonymity of city life and condo living if that wasn't overwhelming enough there was a catch according to the terms of my father's well i was required to move into the house for one year and find out who had murdered my mother thirty years earlier a mother who disappeared when i was six years old and one i barely remembered a state of mind encouraged by my aforementioned father there had been no photos of her around our house no fireside chats about how they met in a barnstable household it was like abigail doris barnstable had never existed to say that my comfortable condo living existence as a call center clerk was flipped upside down would be an understatement one month i was fielding queries about lost credit cards and debit card fraud and the next month i was acting like some sort of unofficial private investigator in market vil no less the house my father had bequeathed to me was nestled within a cold a sack chock full of mostly well maintained nineteen seventies ma anglos split levels and semis the streets named after provincial wild flowers trillium way coneflower crescent day lilly dr lady's slipper lane you get the idea i say mostly well-maintained because my inheritance sixteen snapdragon circle was the singular notable exception the front lawn had long ago succumbed to dandy lions and twitch grass the roof had been patched without any attention to matching the existing shingles the windows were spattered with bird droppings dirt and bits of egg from halloween's past asked some houses needed a little bit of tlc with this house needed was a good coat of fire,1
B002VA8UNG,and really pronounced her deceased and began filling out the paperwork after the doctor came the chaplin a cheerful and rotund fellow who said all the right things about life and love and family and death then he held hands with us in a circle next to the bed for a word of prayer at the nurse's station they had all the paperwork ready to go two months earlier maggie always the consummate planner had insisted i go to a funeral home and get everything set also being a consummate skinflint in some ways she had insisted on a simple cremation no fancy casket no memorial service i had no intention of defying her last wishes in this regard so i signed the papers made sure maggie's body was going to the right place and then left with chris chris would spend the next eighteen hours in his hotel room recovering from near exhaustion i returned to the apartment in troy where maggie and i have been living since i accepted the delphi job a year earlier in july two thousand and five i wandered around a bit and stared at all the touches a picture your hair a potted plant there that she had added to make the sterile rooms our home away from home then overwhelmed with fatigue i crawled into our massive bed maggie had been my bed mate for more than forty years we had held each other and cried in this bed after getting her prognosis now it felt like the emptiest place in the world after a few hours of sleep i arose and dress then went to pick up our youngest son alexander had a nearby hotel still in shock and occasionally in tears i was trying to grasp the notion of being a widower chris needed time to himself so alexander and i went to the funeral home as they were opening for the day and completed the arrangements for maggie's cremation later that same afternoon because i was the ceo of one of the nation's major corporations one that was going through a widely publicized bankruptcy restructuring maggie's death would be news at her insistence we had told almost no one of her condition so her passing was going to come as a shock i had a lot of calls to make and i needed to take some time with details such as death notices and obituaries i went into the office to work on these tasks and was immediately and almost absurdly reminded that in the midst of my personal grief which felt so enormous and all consuming the world continued to turn and the demands of my professional life we're not going to let up for weeks a militant union group called soldiers of solidarity had been planning to pick at delphi headquarters and this was the day and so it was that on this brilliantly sunny morning scores of protesters from delphi operations all over the state of michigan arrived at the entry to our complex and rallied in full view from my office window to show their disgust at the company and at me personally they chanted slogans marched on the sidewalk and carried placards saying things like replace delphi board of derelicts delphi cooks the books worker get burned save pensions jail frauds ready to strike my personal favorite was a sign belittling my decision to accept a salary of just one dollar a year during a restructuring that was going to cost thousands of workers their jobs it read miller isn't worth a buck even in this dark hour i could appreciate the life goes on irony of the moment and the wit behind the signs karen healey one of delphi's top officers wasn't so calm she marched outside to confront the protesters and told him that they might want to reconsider their demonstration out of respect for maggie's death there was a moment of awkward silence and then a sharp rebuttal workers die all the time they said the pickets stayed and were in full voice as i departed for the funeral home in midafternoon alexander and i went to view maggie prior to her cremation chris was not ready to confront this kind of reality the viewing room was big enough for thirty or forty chairs but maggie was an intensely private person and fittingly alive,0
B00BAZBZ5I,since you want to bring that up i said you might as well sit down the desk was staying with the office too not that i have had much use for it on the road and along with it the two chairs i talked to one at the business side of the desk and the woman i'd never seen before took the other then we sat there and stared at each other i couldn't begin to guess what she was thinking but at the moment that was the least of my worries my concern centered around the things she had given me to think about already i'd never been a particularly promiscuous guy at least not as far as i could remember the not as far as i could remember pan was the kicker and that sons of course i wasn't sure which was going to be worse having a realise she'd mistaken me for someone else or having her recognition of me as her husband actually be correct i didn't remember having been married and it didn't seem like the sort of thing i'd be likely to forget but if you were in an inquisitorial mood you could probably say the same thing about my name even if i took the tack that i could have been married to her and totally forgotten it i didn't think that was the answer she implied that she'd recognized me even though i changed my appearance i had a feeling she hadn't been referring to my hairstyle either but to some major total body rework that sounded like pretty heavy magic indeed i suppose it was possible that whoever had hit me with the curse had put me through such a transformation as long as i was playing the odds though it made a lot more sense to go with the most obvious explanation the one named gushing a tantra i'd been wondering why i hadn't heard anything from him there was no clear reason he'd want to leave his metabolic link active indefinitely since it had to be a drain on his resources yet as far as i could tell it was still perfectly intact now i knew he was still using me as a decoy the woman hadn't recognized me per se she recognized the trace of gash that was flavoring my aura through the link she thought i was really him she thought the tastes of gash his own aura i was still carrying was really a little bit of his true identity trickling through an otherwise comprehensive disguise that ring business he'd set me up with before had been pretty tricky but it was looking like i hadn't seen anything yet at least the ring that was business this mess seemed unmistakably personal what had i ever done to him there was another reasonable explanation though as long as i was running through the range of possibilities she could have merely been out of her mind i liked this explanation even less than the others she had str fuck me is both a powerful and a nasty customer and that was assuming her activities add some rational reasoning behind them if she was delusional or outright insane well my best bet was to start finding out if i remembered any good prayers after falling in with max and shale i'd gone back and made a few back payments to to flynn errol the adventurers god just in case but i had no idea if that had put me into his favor or not or if i had ever even been there in the first place,0

B00HSOZ4XO,to obtain the breton territories in a way that could not be disputed william appeal to the king in nine to seven at the very beginning of his rule he had commended himself to charles the simple whom herbert of vermin dwa had briefly released from prison after charles's death the situation was much clearer with the carol engines now apparently out of the picture william could turn to the roberti and king without denying his old bonds of loyalty so in nine three three he commended himself to rudolph in return rudolph granted him the land of the bretons situated on the shore of the sea that is according to most commentators content on and of russia by the time of william long sword then the territory of normandy had been established in almost definitive form to the west the border was now defined by the cousineau which marked the boundary of the diocese of rosh to the northeast it was bordered by the brel and well protected by the fortress of o true william long sword would still intervene in the north to thwart the ambitions of count on-off of flanders and nine three nine arnav seize the castle of mont-royal through cunning hell god's son and successor halloween turned to william for support with williams' help he managed to recapture the key castle this was a serious blow to an offs ambitions but it made him williams implacable enemy the montreux affair was certainly one of the reasons if not the main reason for the ambush at peak piccone in nine four two the southern borders were less clearly delineated although the concession of nine to four may have included the whole of maine the territory that was in fact acquired corresponded only to the hema there was not until the end of the rule of which of the first some time between nine ninety nine ninety six that the duke intervene wind in the region the south of the diocese of says remained a march that largely escaped the control of the dukes of normandy until the eleventh century and beyond and one part of this diocese would never become part of territory of normandy the future archdeacon its of bellingham and corbin a which were added to the county of pesh in the southeast the river of was reached in the nine thirties but this was another fringe area claimed by the count of blois theobald the trickster he sees the county of shark and even took possession of everson for a few years nine sixty nine sixty five it was only after nine sixty five that duke richard the first was really able to assert his authority in everson similarly the pages of lisieux seems to have escaped ducal athol city until the end of the tenth century thus we have seen the establishing and strengthening of the borders was the cause of many conflicts during the tenth century the more or less avowed aim seems to have been to extend the authority of the duke over the whole territory which on the spiritual plane was dependent on the archbishop of ruin this aim was almost complete he realized the only areas not to be absorbed into normandy with a french vaccine which belong to the diocese of rome and pesh most of which belong to the diocese of says the case of normandy is unique in the whole of the kingdom of france no other principality coincided almost exactly with an ecclesiastical province this suggests the extent to which the first dukes were able to form special links with the church and especially with the archbishop of rule from paganism to christianity relations between the scandinavian rulers and the church were not easy at first rollo was seen as a pagan chief and could only be accepted if he agreed to be baptized but this baptism not only of rollo but also of his companion was not enough to make the normans good christians conversion was an eminently political act as many viking nieto's had realized was rollover conversion sincere this is a very difficult question to answer due to presents him as a committed christian who made gifts even of regions he had not yet conquered to the principal church searches of the province of rwanda we know that there is a great deal of reconstruction in this version of events written nearly a century,0

B0733P3ZS2,i walked into my first interview with high hopes that were quickly dashed we'd barely gotten past the pleasantries when the representative from union carbide asked when are you planning to have children it all went downhill from there next step was heinz a jolly interviewer offered me a job almost right away he wanted to hire me to study the vitamin c in tomatoes he was nice enough but his statement that it would almost be like being in the kitchen made me clench my jaw tight to keep my abusive thoughts to myself and frankly there was nothing about that job that was vital to the effort to win the war no matter how hard he tried to expand the definition of that phrase by the time i walked into the interview with a man from eastman kodak i was on the verge of giving up when i asked what the job entailed he said do you know anything about eastman kodak i've used your cameras and was pleased with them good he said and leaned back in his chair smiling really was that it i pushed on what kind of work would you want me to do it's war work we are hiring a number of technical people for vital war work what kind of technical people we're hiring chemist i have a baccalaureate from bryn mawr with a double major in chemistry and physics neck this month i will receive a master's degree in analytic chemistry from the university of pennsylvania is he hearing me is he really listening to me or had he already looked at my skirt and scratched me off his list he leaned forward slowly and steeples his fingers and said good good you're definitely the kind of technical person we're looking to hire as chemists for this work and your additional background info physics is an added bonus what kind of war work i asked his answers were vague and evasive why i wanted more details about the scope of the position but if i pushed too hard would i offend him and ruin my chances of receiving an important job offer he smiled brushed a lock of hair off his forehead and leaned back in his chair i can't tell you it's a secret a secret now that sounded like war work where would i work at your headquarters in rochester ohno then where would it be sorry can't tell you oh it's a secret a secret location that does sound promising but it is vital work that could help win the war i asked most certainly i can assure you it's good i wanted to know more what is the goal of the work i can't tell you the secret how long will the job last until the war is over are you offering me a job i can't tell you that secret he said setting his mouth in a grim line i was dumbfounded that was the most ridiculous thing that i had heard all day his eyes twinkled as his face bro look into a broad grin that was a little joke he laughed of course i am your country needs you miss clark will you answer the call i nodded my head faster than i could think yes yes i will i said surprised at recklessness of my spontaneity what had i just agreed to do good you will be hearing from us shortly about the transportation arrangements for your trip to rochester for your orientation with the company my head was spinning looping like a rollercoaster staggering under the burden of unanswered questions i felt numb i had one more appointment scheduled but it wasn't for an hour i hunted down the recruiter from ames and cancelled our session telling him i'd accepted another offer but didn't really believe the words even as i said them i had a job i had achieved my goal on the train ride home dauch rose to the surface had i been right to trust that evasive eastman kodak man the work had to be important if it was top secret to knit maybe i shouldn't have cancelled that last interview i hoped i hadn't made a naive mistake,1
B06ZZ2118M,when the phone rang i rolled over with a groan and reach for it who could possibly be calling me i didn't have any friends left and all my bills were paid up thanks to last month's trip to atlantic city's casinos low i mumbled into the receiver my head pounded something awful pit asked a man's voice i blinked nobody had called me that in years how is this pit thank god i reached you i need your help huh i managed to sit up in bed the room swayed i felt sick and dizzy i help who is this god periods three o'clock aren't you awake what three o'clock with my free hand i rubbed it crusty feeling eyes it didn't ha help i felt old and tired and all fogged up inside thirty years old and ready to die call me in the daytime the voice on the phone chuckled it sounded forced come on pitt the man said urgently it's three o'clock in the afternoon wake up you're the sharp a guy i know i need your help slowly i tried to think it through only frat brothers had ever called me pit short for a pit bull because i never let go so that meant we had gone to college together a lifetime or so ago that most in any given year our fraternity had thirty two members to times for a lively selection of suspects pet you still there i frowned a decade had deepened his voice but it sounded familiar like a gear clicking into place my brain started working and the name came to me david hunt tall blonde and good looking in a calvin klein model sort of way mostly skilled in partying and racket ball but good enough academically to get his mba without any special assistance from me that was the only reason they let me into old alpha kappa after all to help the jocks and old money frat boys keep up their gp a's sometimes i had resented being there to be used but mostly i didn't care since the perks were great i got into all the parties i had my share of dates and fun and beer and i still graduated at the top of our class so what if i did a lot of tutoring and ghost writing day david had been fifty third yes that was right fifty third in our graduating class more than respectable for a party boy from alpha kappa what is it davey i said the haze was lifting now and i go by peter these days peter right come see me i i need your help i'll make it worth your while i yawned again where are you the mac and chase hotel i'll be in the lobby twenty minutes okay make it an hour if i have to but hurry a frantic note crept into his voice my future does depends on it he hung up since he sounded desperate i debated skipping a shower but one look in the mirror and a sniff at my armpits change my mind i could live with bloodshot eyes and must have hair but popular society frowned on people who smelled like i did right now having my legs over the side of the bed i found a bottle of aspirin on the night table and dry swallowed four tablets i right foot bumped against a half empty bottle of jack daniels on the floor and briefly i debated a wakeup shot no not now i had an appointment to keep instead i screwed the cap back on i spent the next fifteen minutes showering shaving and cleaning myself up for polite society a gulp of half flat pepsi and a cold slice of pizza from the refrigerator made a very late breakfast then i found a shirt that wasn't too rumpled and put it on with jeans and comfortable old loafers finished i grabbed a cane from the umbrella stand by the door left my little one bedroom northwood apartment and limped out to the frankford el station the train came almost immediately luckily,1
B00EHOUJJ2,there was one good thing about having to spend the night with your parents after your house got broken into in the middle of the night because your sister was an idiot when they had to get up early to go to work and you didn't so you could avoid the talk the next morning where they would want to know all about your idiot sister how she put you in danger how you put yourself in days anger why you didn't tell them right off the bat and why you've been keeping your perfect army man boyfriend to yourself so sleeping in i avoided talking to dad and meredith however when i went to the kitchen for coffee on the counter i found a note from dad which said gee tonight dinner six sharp be there your window probably won't be fixed for a week so pack a bag don't disappear arm calling cam and sending leo after you love you dad they say men are attracted to women who are like their mothers and women are attracted to men who are like their fathers this must be true considering i'm attracted to hot uber macho bossy guys i also had a note from meredith which said morning honey they're fresh bagels in the fridge einstein's whipped cream cheese your favorite see you tonight hugs meredith p s i cannot tell you how happy i am for you after meeting hawk he's so cute and he sui and he smitten ye cute sweet smitten with underlines and yea obviously my dad wasn't attracted to women like me good to know after coffee a bagel and note reading i had taken more than my usual going to sit at a computer all day care with my appearance because i can running into hot guys usually i worked in yoga pants camisoles or baby doll tees and lightweight hoodies or if it was summer i might switch it up with shorts that morning i'd used meredith's makeup and curling iron why she needed a curling iron with curly hair i did not know but she had everything that had anything to do with being a girl one of the many reasons why i loved her i curled my long hair into a mass of curls and waves with a heavy fall of hair at the front i also put on makeup something i never did unless i was going out the rest i couldn't help i'd packed in the middle of the night after a break in meeting a new hot guy and another bizarre and annoying but unfortunately hot confrontation with hawk so it was just jeans and a light blue tea from thrifty stick a cool border shop on broadway i didn't board but like i mentioned i could shop anywhere it had a black skull and crossbones above my breasts that had a red t and s and red bands around the neckline and sleeves to this i added a black belt boots and a thin hooded cardi sweater and i was glad i curled my hair and my makeup i was also glad i had on my killer wire rimmed cop shades with the grey semi mirrored lenses when i drove up to my house and saw it had a bunch of motorcycles and a big black van parked in front of it holy freaking crap i drove into my driveway trying to steer my little blue hyundai in while still keeping my eyes on what appeared to be an army of bikers hanging out on my lawn and going in and out of my house clearly my house wasn't hard to break into as had been proved last night it had been made easier by the fact there was only a board where the window should be but now the door was wide open and the board was gone in fact the entire window is gone and tac was standing on my lawn with the dog he was wearing cool mirrored shades too and they were pointed toward my car i barely pulled up the parking brake when tack moved away from dog and started in my direction therefore when i got out he was there pinning me between my car and the door i looked up at him instantly comparing shorter than both hawk and lawson but he could seriously work facial hair and i wasn't having a flight of fancy the day before on the hotter meter he rang the top bell and he rang it loud hey i said but it came out kind of breathy hey peaches he replied not breathy at all but deep and gravelly and what are you doing here i asked taking that opportunity to glance toward my house see a biker had a tape measure and was measuring my window heard word yet a visitor last night tack said and i looked back at him kind of he was interrupted before i could offer him some chocolate chip cookie dough,0

B002V19RVE,scholars to go round the blame cannot simply be laid at the door of such a recent development the staff has been sitting there for years at this rate more parts of huckleberry finn for whom the bell tolls and goodness knows what else is still destined to languish unpublished not in someone's attic which i could understand but in the very precincts of academia that are supposed to protect and preserve them for the rest of us enough a few words about the manuscript itself since the discovery of the so called swingline dobson text in nineteen seventy an entire cottage industry of newly discovered warzone and manuscripts has cluttered the field of sherlock ian scholarship thumb may well be authentic others palpably are not in doozy as the perpetrators are second in their creative zeal only to howard hughes his autobiographies and those writing entries into hitler's diaries the chief problem posed by any warzone and text must of course be the question of authenticity in the case of the present manuscript known as the canary trainer the question of provenance is complicated by a number of factors first although the paper and ink conform to the proper time and place and the manual skill itself appears to be indisputably written in watson's hand the paper and ink have been vouched for by the forensics department of scotland yard and professor van meegeren of the national gallery london the handwriting has been certified as watsons by two experts in the field whom i am not at liberty to name from langley virginia this is not a case in which watson appears as either a witness or a participant watson's text was seemingly dictated in whole or part by holmes himself which greatly confuses the issue of authorial voice one of the crucial methods by which sherlock ian scholars seek to identify fire genuine text the voice of homes is not the voice of watson and while a case related by holmes himself is not unique the adventure of the lion's mane comes readily to mind as another example it does entail stylistic differences which can only serve to perplex those wishing to make a definitive authentication it is equally difficult to rule out watson's contribution entirely as i have noted the manuscript is in his own hand and therefore the can be no way of knowing to what degree the doctor altern shortened or otherwise amended homes his story why it was never typed which would doubtless have entailed more corrections and alterations on watson's part i cannot guess perhaps a revised and completed typescript does or did exist somewhere else if it hasn't been destroyed many of these questions may be answered more fully some day aams may have been off and running onto something else before watson who seems to have been asking the questions had a chance to tidy up a bunch of loose ends the manuscript does break off with the sudden arrival of herbert asquith and watson may idly have suppose he could finish it up later only later and never came for that matter it is impossible to say to what degree homes typically exercised editorial control over a warzone and text on the one hand he is constantly quoted as denigrating watson's efforts deriding them for their sensational content and their exclusion of pure logic but using much the same effect as if you had worked at a love story or an elopement into the fifth proposition of euclid but on the other hand it is clear that these same accounts have been published with his consent homes like many a famous figure may well have connived at his own public image as for the writing itself the evidence is contradictory as to whether or not watson was taking pure dictation parts of the manuscript bear the impressive hasty composition the writing is nearly illegible with abbreviations and other symptoms of an ad hoc nature suggesting a kind of improvised shorthand that might have been prompted by the need to keep pace with the speaker in other places however the penmanship as well as the prose style itself suggest a more leisurely method of composition one in which watson might well be creating as opposed to merely copying a word about americanism as i felt obliged to point out in my introduction to the manuscript known as the west and horror many amateur sleuths believe they can detect a spurious watson text by pointing out american expressions thereby,1

B006TCIVFE,a bit of a cliche to say that flight changed my life but hey cliches exist for a reason i got more and more passionate about christensen's research and his ideas i did independent research for and during my last semester at harvard took a job heading up his research activities after graduation wrote a book with him and in two thousand and three joined into sight the professional services company he had cofounded in two thousand i found christensen research exhilarating i'd held a perception surely shared by many readers that innovation and growth were just random here was someone who drew on a diverse range of case studies and academic research to counter that viewpoint christensen showed how there were actual patterns that dictated success and failure the implication was that by studying and applying the patterns people could improve their ability to succeed with innovation i would quickly learn that christensen was one of a small group of scholars and practitioners joined in a quest to make innovation a predictable discipline chapter two describes select members of this group the notion of bringing predictability to innovation immediately resonated with me but to be honest i wasn't exactly sure why then i finally put my finger on it i had needed this disciplined understanding of innovation when i faced my own innovators dilemma back in nineteen ninety five my early innovation experiences i've been focusing exclusively on innovation for more than a decade now in that time i've been a researcher a writer a strategic adviser to large and small companies and entrepreneur building businesses in the united states and in asia and an investor and startup companies my innovation experience actually predates these experiences innovation has in fact surrounded me my entire life i came to learn that my grandfather who will meet in more depth in chapter one introduced a powerful business model innovation in the nineteen sixties in the late nineteen eighties my mother launched a business called relay net which was a precursor to the internet in an alternative universe she ended up becoming america online co-founder steve case selling relay net to time warner for billions unfortunately in this universe she transferred ownership to another bulletin board owner for nothing my mother also pitched a book idea in the early nineteen nineties for a series of books that provided simple step by step instructions for how to use computers under the title up and running the publishers thought the idea wouldn't sell tens of millions of for dummies copies later fortunately for my family psychological balance my mother found a place where she could devote her energy and passion breeding a line of champion labradors as i was growing up my family was always an early adopter of new technologies i remember playing star raiders on our atari twenty six hundred micro league baseball on our commodore sixty four one on one larry bird versus dr jay on our apple two and tech mobo on our nintendo i was active on relay nat in my teenage years even writing an application that one poor soul paid twenty five dollars to register fast forward to my college years the setting for my innovator's dilemma by day i was an economics major and i took my studies seriously by night i was active in the dartmouth dartmouth college's five day a week paper i was an accidental journalist honestly i joined the newspaper because the one commitment i made to myself upon coming to dartmouth was that i would find a serious extra curricular activity although i was happy that i had gotten into dartmouth getting rejected as an undergraduate by harvard and stanford stung and it was pretty obvious to me why i was rejected as my most serious out of school activity in high school was serving as a founding member of the young john madden's fan club i wandered into the newspaper's offices in robinson hall in the fall of nineteen ninety two and almost immediately fell in love a few years later when i went to work in management consulting i would learn that journalism is a lot like consulting you have a problem that you have to solve in a pretty short time you gather as much data as you can can synthesize that data i presented,0

B002V0M730,back bay was an old wealthy area of boston the tall narrow brownstones boasted granite arches elaborate wrought iron balconies and expansive bay windows broad shade trees beautiful in the summer but now mere silhouettes cast their skeletal canopies over b m w's sobs and mercedes while in the glow of the police floodlights gray veins of leafless ivy climbed up red brick walls and caressed intricate window casings it was a beautiful city block grand self contained slightly arrogant bobby could work his entire life and still not be able to afford to park on the street like this let alone live here you're funny how some people could seemingly have every advantage in life and still be so royally fucked up distance would not be a problem he determined the brownstone sat shoulder to shoulder with only fifty yards between one side of the street and the other angle was more of a consideration anything greater than forty five degrees and the ballistics grew problematic the brownstone in question appeared to be five stories plus a daylight basement the ceo had commented however that the fifth floor had essentially become a vaulted ceiling for a fourth story master bedroom that would fit what bobby saw now lights blazing on the fourth story where there appeared to be a balcony with an elaborate wrought iron railing he crossed the street where he could get a better view the space between the wrought iron rails of the balcony appeared to be approximately three inches no problem given he trained monthly to nail a one inch kill zone angle however became tricky shooting straight through the three inch gap would be a piece of cake trying to shoot up or shoot down more than thirty degrees however bobby definitely had to get off the ground bobby i the four-story brownstone directly across from the gagnon and moments later was banging on the front door while lieutenant jacques romo had told him uniforms had already evacuated area residents bobby wasn't surprised when a bright eyed older man in a dark green robe immediately threw open the old wooden door it was amazing how many the people wouldn't leave their houses even when surrounded by heavily armed men hey the man said are you a cop because i already told the other one i wasn't leaving i need access to the top floor bobby said is that a rifle sir this is official police business i need access to the top floor right top floor is the master bedroom ooh the man's eyes went wide i get it my balconies across from the gagnon you must be a police sniper who can i get you anything just the top floor sir immediately the man was dying to please george harlow was a consultant he informed bobby as he hastily lead the way up a sweeping central staircase he was almost always on the road pure dumb luck he'd been home tonight at all to let bobby in his brownstone was smaller not quite as nice as the others but he owned the whole damn thing drove his condominium neighbor's not speculating what the single family dwelling must be worth why just last month a say single family townhouse in back bay sold for nearly ten million dollars ten million dollars yep george's lush of a father hadn't left him such a bad inheritance after all of course the property taxes were killing him could george please touch the police rifle bobby said no they arrived at the bedroom the vast sp face bore hardly any furniture let alone art on the walls the man must travel a lot because bobby had seen hotel rooms with more personality the front wall was all glass however with sliders right in the middle perfect kill the lights he requested mister harlow nearly giggled as he complied do you have a tape all i could use nothing fancy and a chair mister harlow had a card table bobby set it up while his host rounded up a metal folding chair bobby's breathing had accelerated the climb up four flights or the adrenalin of a night that was about to officially begin he had now been on scene for sixteen minutes not bad time but not great more guys had probably already arrived the perimeter was getting fine tuned soon another officer would show up to serve as spotter providing two pairs of eyes then would come the crisis negotiation team finally making contact by bobby set up his sig sauer on the table he cracked the sliders one inch just enough for the tip of his rifle then he sat down in mister harlow's metal chair turned on the radio mounted in his flak vest and started to talk into the microphone receiver that was tucked inside his ear and worked off the vibrations of his jawbone,1
B00OI2T3SQ,she was older a few lifelines a few gray roots a crease of sadness across her brow hollywood had been filled with sweet young things ready to do anything but maggie in those mouth watering genes was no less desirable to him than she'd been at eighteen cooper watched from his attic window as maggie negotiated the cracked flagstone path the dog at her heels he was an odd little mutt gazing up at cooper with intelligence in his brown eyes maggie slid open the door of her van to reveal an interior crammed with suitcases boxes and kitchen junk he should have helped her but seeing her had knocked him sideways sure he'd known she'd eventually come and he'd gotten past feeling like a failure but somehow facing maggie made all his mistakes fresh ago again weariness burrow deep into his bones he worked as a nightwatchman at the high school and would have been in bed at this time of day that's where she would have found him when she arrived which might have proven to be pretty damn hot now that he'd seen her but he'd been afraid the porch would fall down if he didn't fix it today since the day cecilia passed the whole house had been sliding into decrepitude she should have let him call maggie when the doctors diagnosed the cancer maggie would have come running but cecilia stated she wasn't about to bring maggie back to an old lady on her deathbed she claimed there was a time for everything and maggie would come home for the house not for her what had gone wrong between them cecilia never said he knew only that maggie was married and had a kid cecilia never saw she blamed herself just as he now blamed himself for not calling maggie months ago he should never have listened to cecilia there were some dying wishes a man shouldn't keep below his attic window maggie skipped down the path with a box under one arm as she threw a rope tug for the dog the mot ran after it twirled in a circle then snatched the rope and ran back dropping it at maggie's feet so they could play the game again when elton cook told cooper that the now divorced maggie was taking over the place his housemates were afraid she'd kick them all out cooper knew better cecilia as will stood in the way but beyond that maggie was neither selfish nor vindictive at least not the maggie he'd known twenty two years ago from the way she laughed as she threw the rope he didn't think she'd changed much no matter the cards life had delta or maybe that was wishful thinking on his part cooper wanted her to be the girl he remembered the girl he'd loved the girl who got away she was back and she was no longer married,0
B00DWC07GU,stephen porches the psychiatry professor and neuroscientist at the university of illinois at chicago believes the key to our psychological development as human beings lies not solely in our brains but below them along the nerve that serves as the two lane racetrack for the signals that zoo ip back and forth between our brains and the rest of our bodies he focuses on the tenth cranial nerve known as the vagus nerve a strip of fibers that originates in the medulla oblongata a part of the brainstem and winds around the most important parts of our bodies from the head and throat to the lungs heart and digestive system it's like a miniature speedway running around our most vital organs not very many people understand the crucial role it plays in our decisions poor jess began his doctoral research on this neural racetrack during the late nineteen sixties just as the discipline of psychology was splintering some researchers were advocating psychotropic drugs while others were preoccupied with death four just joined the society for psychophysiological research a relatively obscure cluster of practical minded academics who wanted to combine psychology and physiology the dream of this group's members including porches was to improve our understanding of human behavior by monitoring people's bodies in real time they were frustrated by the increasing reliance on subjective questioning and self reporting and they had limited interest in having patients lie on sofas and talk about their childhood three times a week instead of trusting the words that came out of patients' mouths these researchers wanted to test the changes in patients' bodies as portus explained it to me the goal was to understand patients' psychological states without having to talk to them gorgeous decided to study the heart he thought the high speed nerve connections between our brains and hearts were central to understanding human emotion he wanted to prove he could assess our psychological health simply by measuring the changes in our heart rates to the nearest millisecond he envisioned that future psychologists my diagnose and even predict mental orders simply by timing the hearts of their patients like many genius insights poor jess his ideas seemed downright crazy at first why would tiny changes in our heart rates matter to our mental health yes our hearts beat faster when we are agitated and slower when we are calm but we barely perceive any of that the variance is a fraction of a second and although it's interesting to know that our heart rates go up when we inhale and down when we exhale it doesn't affect our sanity or emotional health our heart rates vary but the changes don't suddenly make us go crazy tried breathe in and out in out in out you can't feel that your heart is speeding up when you breathe in and slowing down when you breathe out but it is nor will you feel more or less manic or depressed because you aren't so what was portus thinking before portus wrote his dissertation on heart rate variability and reaction time research on the topic hadn't progressed much since charles darwin over one hundred years ago speculated based on the earlier writings of french physiologist claude bernard that human emotional states might be driven by a rapid fire brain heart feedback loop just as darwin anticipated so many later discoveries in other areas is suggested in one passage that the vagus nerve then called the numa gastric nerve was eroded carrying signals from the brain to the heart and back as darwin wrote in eighteen seventy two when the mind is strongly excited we might expect that it would instantly effect in a direct manner the heart and this is universally acknowledged when the heart is affected it reacts on the brain and the state of the brain again reacts through the numa gastric nerve on the heart so that under any excitement there will be much mutual action and react action between these the two most important organs of the body,0
B006GF6NMW,hey the sword in which the heat accumulated making june see my gog ist the asphalt was already hot in the parking lot it made him hip hop his way to the dumpster with his offering he noticed a flashy red sports car that he hadn't seen at the marina before on the way back he saw a dark shape in the driver's seat regaining the cooler would of the dark he looked back to confirm it it was a ferrari the windows were uptight some one was inside he scurried to the driver's side where shadow kept the pavement cool and peered in the woman was sleeping head back mouth open rivulets of sweat running into her dark hair like a face emerging from a pool he tapped on the glass and she started hugged herself protectively worked at getting her bearings he better roll the windows down miss you're going to bake in there shoulders slumping suddenly aware of the stifling heat she seemed to realize he wasn't a threat when she opened the door the superheated air hit him in a wave she half rolled out of the low seed steadied herself with a hand on the door as she stood where where the rich tone of her skin went sallow before his eyes as her knees buckled charlie caught her by one limp and sweat slippery arm he got her under the armpits then awkwardly up across his chest her neck stretched so far back and seem broken for a second he stood there wondering what to do then got the idea to fight heat with cold character to the wooden hut where the marina showers were hesitated a moment on the silly consideration of whether to go into the one marked boys or the one marked gulls hearing no noise from either he walked into the men's shower spun the cold water knob and stood there as it ran over both of them she came to sputtering and flailing at the water eyes closed he put her down on the step outside he pushed her head toward her knees and held it there until enough blood got to her brain that he could feel some strength fighting back when he led her up she looked at him uncomprehending heads swiveling around as she struggled to focus on something familiar he spoke softly hero came as everything's alright you are asleep in your car and it got very hot when i woke you you got out and faded i ran the shower on you to cool you down bring you around he kept on like that until she began to compose herself issued a few ohs and ahs to indicate she was remembering how she got there finally she looked down at herself her white duck trousers and salmon colored blouse clung to her and made it rather obvious that she'd made a hasty job of dressing either that or she didn't believe in underwear she did a thing with her elbows and knees covering up charlie noticed a green beach towel hanging on the rail behind her it occurred to him to drape it around her but that impulse was easily checked on the rationalization that one could be chivalrous to a fault while the woman's body language was circling the wagons around her ample endowments her head was unbowed and unabashed as it took in the surroundings did you have to try to drown me right about then he realized that she was one of those women who take the breath away even soaking like a wharf rat her teeth were as white and even as chocolates the blue eyes had those fancy radial lines and the irises these set in angular cheekbones that changed the look for from sears catalog to oat couture he realized she had the kind of looks guys like him saw in movies then didn't bother to dream about they were so far out of reach if i'd wanted to drown you i could have tossed you in the harbor a cool rag would have been sufficient i think look lady nobody said to wake you up before your brains baked or catch you before you broke your face on the asphalt either but that's what i did and the water seemed like a good idea at the time he reached over and grabbed the towel tossed it at her she caught it surprised he turned and started down the dock thinking this was a good example of why he'd never strained himself chasing face heavy women they got so much attention they became spoiled people put up with there being peckish so they forgot their manners,1
B002V0JYT0,that granted me permission to quote from any and all of his books and shortly thereafter invited me to interview him at his home in claremont california we set the dates of the interview for december twenty second and december twenty third a two day period that would include a far ranging discussion of topics i asked rocker if he would like to see the questions i intended to ask in advance he said yes so i spent much of a week polishing a list of some two dozen questions that i thought most pertinent to the theme of the book when i asked drug her if the questions were satisfactory he said yes and no the questions are fine he wrote but there are far too many of them drucker then asked me to reduce the number to a maximum of six i was taken aback how could we spend two days with only five or six questions to discuss clearly i did not yet get drucker who i would learn later could fashion a day's discourse around any subject from management to society to japanese art d day monday december twenty second two thousand and three five forty a m i awoke to the sounds of large aircraft speeding down runways and for a few seconds forgot where i was and took a few moments to collect myself it was the kind of cloudless blue sky december morning one finds only in southern california thousands of miles from the sleet in chicago as i quickly showered and then dressed in suit and tie i realized not without irony that i knew little about peter drucker the man i knew a great deal about his writings his business philosophy his management tenants having read more than once the vast majority of his thirty five books on management and management and society drucker wrote extensively about the relationship between management and society even his bp memoir adventures of a bystander reveal little about who he really was listened to the epilogue for some highlights from that book i grabbed the two tape recorders i had brought with me the car keys and the books and headed out to the rental car i could not help but reflect wryly on how i had gotten there to people in the business book industry drucker was a singular figure the man who add more or less discovered the discipline of management and become its chronicler but drug had many critics who felt he had lost his edge and relevance and it wasn't only the usual suspects such as the academic elite who regarded drucker as a has been or and almost was the dean of the peter f drucker graduate school of management to claremont graduate university later told business week's john byrne this drucker is a brand in decline drucker who was incredibly self aware and no less so now surely had heard similar rumblings i suspected that he had his legacy in mind when he agreed to my request for an interview i knew the criticism of drucker was unfounded after many hundreds of hours of research it became increasingly clear that the popular press and the academic elite had gotten it wrong his writing served as the foundation for a great number of business best sellers published during the post nineteen eighty business book boom tom peters author of in search of excellence one of the two management books that launched the modern day boom said no true discipline of management existed before drucker he also said drucker was the creator and inventor of modern management and the early nineteen fifties nobody had a toolkit to manage these incredibly complex organizations that had gone out of control drucker was the first person to give us a handbook for that incredibly peters also reportedly said everything we have written in in search of excellence could be found in some corner or other of the practice of management a noteworthy management and organizational behavioral expert charles handy said virtually everything can be traced back to drucker and jim collins another exceptional business author acknowledged drucker's contributions as well calling him the leading founder of the field of management he also wrote that drucker's primary contribution is not a single idea but rather an entire body of work but as one gigantic advantage,0

B0794G8SJF,by the time big lakes volunteer fire department arrived on the scene the shed was fully engulfed and all they could do was water down the grass and trees to keep the flames from spreading a couple of old bicycles a broken lawnmower and an assortment of junk were lost in the fire after the fire was out the firemen couldn't determine what had started it and since it was a minor incident there wasn't an investigation love is blind so when he got home tom cotter accepted jill's claim that she had been shopping at the walmart in show low at the time of the fire without question and set about cleaning up the rubble of what had been his shed one unexplained fire may not get much notice but two in less than a week in a town the size of big lake does four days after tom cotter shed burned flames were discovered shooting out of the roof of an abandoned barn on santa fe lane since he was a mile outside of town and because they had to cut a lock off a gate to get to the barn by the time firefighters got to the scene it was too late to do anything to save the decrepit old building as with the burst blaze all they could do was watch it burn and be on the alert to keep the fire from spreading to the grass around the barn any idea who owns his place sheriff jim weber asked by our chief steve harper as part of the barn's roof bell and sending a shower of sparks skyward harper shook his head it was part of the old mayor plays but i think the bank took it over a while back after henry died and it went into foreclosure you might as wally mcknight over the real estate office i remember henry meyer weber said always wore bib overalls no shirt summer winner didn't he have a kid a boy mark harper told him nodding he get cancer or something and died a couple of years beforehand three dead broke at old man's heart i think that's what really killed him kevin upchurch who worked as a maintenance man for the school system when he wasn't responding to fire calls join them wiping sweat off his forehead upchurch and harper had been best friends since childhood had joined the army and served as part of the peace keeping mission in korea together and then came home to big lake where they married local girls and raised their families on the same street while harper was the smaller of the two by several inches and easily seventy five pounds he was the unquestioned leader in everything they did upchurch had always seemed happy to let his friend blake the trail while he followed happily along covering his back up church nodded at weber and took a long pull from a plastic water bottle harper handed him but haven't had a fire all summer long and now we get to this week what's that tell you makes a man think harper said could be a coincidence i guess good may the bigger man said or maybe we got us a firebug let's hope not webber said he guys mind poking around and seeing what you can come up with once is cools down we'll stay until it's good now but it'll be dark by the ann arbor told him i'll come back tomorrow and see what i can find if anything weber thanked them and left to fire him and oversee the mop up operation as he pulled away and started back to town he hoped upchurch was wrong and that the second fire coming so close on the heels of the first one was just a coincidence but he'd worn a badge long enough that he didn't believe in coincidence any longer,1

B00K2A7W04,antonio wipes the side of his face as droplets of sweat emerge partially due to his body trying to cool itself but more likely caused by his overflowing guilt a white bandanas fixed to the top of his head still somewhat moist from the well water the hot mexican sun drying it rapidly his brown eyes and short stature make him appear unremarkable and antonio's natural demeanor seems pleasant almost as though he could be a member of your family from a second floor balcony of a bright orange vacation resort he gazes with disappointment at the jungle just a few dozen yards from his position his eggshell colored shirt is covered in dirt stains as or as black jeans he puts his hands on his hips staring down toward the black leather belt that he procured from the father of a family of five several hours earlier antonio raises his head again looking into the jungle just below his line of vision he sees a warrior wasp hovering above the wooden railing right in front of his post the wasp moves his black body tactfully above the weathered brown wood seeking out anything useful to it's colony as he looks at the wasp he thinks about the cartel and draws a strong distinction of common ground between the colony of deadly insects and his organization of deadly smugglers there is a sinister connection antonio thinks to himself regarding how the federalist set up a roadblock on highway one eighty six preventing them from getting back to their nest with over one hundred million dollars in cocaine they were forced to migrate north of the highway pushing deeper into the old jungle when they found the bright orange resort in only one family of five protecting it the colony of twenty wasps slaughtered the worker bees and took refuge in the new nest antonio sighs with shame as his gaze races back to the jungle and he thinks about the five bodies they just buried there within the cartel he has become known as antonio grave digger espinosa a man who has dug over one thousand graves and lost count a long time ago he ponders all the different graves his dog and the various purposes for those graves antonio knows that his sensible grave begins by making cuts into the earth using a shovel to create an oval shape then digging about three feet down into the center of the oval allowing him to leverage the shovel and tear out large chunks of earth with little effort it is also important to layer the earth around the grave evenly so that it can be filled in faster choosing the right earth with a flaky moist consistency to dig the graves also drastically cuts down the burial time he even came up with a cocktail of herbs to throw off the dogs that might be looking for bodies his own mixture of chili peppers cinnamon and freshly ground coffee though an emerge muncie situations like this one where bodies must go immediately into the ground those ingredients rarely present themselves in time he glances over to his right at his amigo enrique a senior smuggler who has been the best and worst of everything in his thirty years with the cartel the fifty year old enforcer stands vigilant in the opposite corner of the balcony watching a cash drugs like a faithful dog his clad in a light soft material tailored to fit his body making him appear wise his pants and shirt are made from the same black and gold fabric giving it the look of a uniform enrique smiles wide at antonio unintentionally showing that he is missing all of the molders from his bottom jaw and half the teeth in his upper jaw although he is nearly twenty years older than antonio the veteran enforcer has a powerful body maintained by daily exercises and a diet dictated by nature antonio's amazed to see this man smiling after having lost his second son just a few nights ago he smiles back at enrique with a great deal of respect knowing that the man next to him has lost both of his sons one from a rival cartel and the other from a shootout with mexican authorities enrique turns away for a moment scanning the jungle with ak forty seven clenched tightly in his arms as the older man turns away antonio sees the familiar machetes slung over enrica shoulder with a black sheath tight against his back antonio looks out into the jungle again remembering the five graves but his heart goes cold as he sees a figure standing among the tech sodium mooc not to him trees a woman with long brunette hair is walking along the tree line her body is covered by a full length red robe the robe is secured around her with what looks like a thick black rope earlier in the day the smugglers chopped down a few trees and cleared a path for the helicopter to land the woman walks around the outer edge of this new landing zone seemingly oblivious to the men guarding the resort the young enforcer closes his eyes for a moment and as he reopens them the woman is no longer there his heart starts to beat fast as he remembers killing the mother of the family and wonders if in his haste he neglected to finish her off,1
B07Q5VL7PS,and so it must be for so it is written on the doorway to paradise that those who falter and those who fall must pay the price herbert kretzmer chapter one how to explain my job to a human when i haven't been human for twenty years my human body was stolen from me by two scientist in my mind forced into something not human fifteen scientists allegedly died that night in staged accidents two days later and i snapped the neck of one myself the other tall were like me stuck in a much taller stronger body with ghostly voices in the back of our heads i escaped the facility that pulled out off that night and actually listened to the voice in my head because really when your face is on a different body and you could crush things with your bare hands if you weren't careful you'll believe anything the other scientists were not so lucky they were being held in cells at a facility called genetic corp i was hungry all the time and eating like crazy when i escaped the scientists at the facility ranged from seven who thought they were in a mental institution and that was why they were hearing things and five who actually listened to the voices and had stopped eating hoping the body would die and free both of them the process other cells merging with a new house was not happening as rapidly as me because they were being fed hospital food and not the massive amounts of me i needed to stay full there were two we had to kill later their changes being fueled by pure negativity and poisoning the light inside them i had to poison them with ryzen then snap their necks i really only stopped one night before i was flung back into the wall and blinded by a white light i finally saw the person in my head really looked like they looked like us tall muscular and delight coming off then the hurt your eyes when they wanted to let shine he nearly killed me till i explained i was helping the others i'm still not sure why they didn't describe me bring me back to the facility and forced me to treat the others since they been watching me and knew i was hiding out in abandoned bush c-store i was approached by the man who was laughing as i thought i was dying and i learned was the brains behind his entire experiment i had gotten access to my old laugh through my law partner joe with a fake identity gabriel the cruel man with the blue eyes for some reason decided to approach me like a doctor instead of just grabbing me and trying to figure out why i was the only one who thought his experiment worked on i still don't know if he knew how this would end he would have done it the same those of us that were forced into new bodies were given the navy uses by mitra the woman in my head it means dawn in sanskrit we were the dawn but eventually we would become the light like her we burn the genetic court building down and capture gabriel and michael the scientists behind doing this to us the rest is a little more complicated it was explained to me by meteor that death and the afterlife is a lot more scientific than anyone realized and somewhat based on the laws of thermodynamics reincarnation is a part of it but if i said that demitra or any like her they would just shake their heads at me like i was being silly everything living is energy it can even be created nor destroyed when a person dies their energy goes to the void until it finds a new vessel energy can become positive or negative throughout different lifetimes lenses that is threshold and final life it because reborn is pure positive energy or pure negative energy negative energy and back humans and attempts to play in twisted ways corrupting the human in air anything else it can along the way the older it is the stronger it gets it eventually sprouts wings like meters kind they covet their wings because they are harder to kill that way a newly infected just goes back to the void when meter in hurricane kills the vessel it occupies if it had wings it went back to the void naturally when the vessel expired if meijer and the others may managed to find it the only way to free it was to cut off it's wings or would just get up and walk around in a corpse spreading disease i didn't know this will meet your first started talking to me she just told me to go to a bad area town and try to see the infection for myself i ended up seeing something worse than any horror movie i'd ever seen i barged into the apartment it was in because it was molesting a child and videotaping it i had no idea what i thought i was going to do i was just raging and not thinking when it realised i was there and charged at me i reacted in a very human way and just whipped out the gun i bought and shot in the head it didn't even faze me after everything that i kept talking to me with a bullet between it's eyes and told me a free and by ripping his wings off i was dubbed the you should like the other twelve scientist isaac my lab partner's brother was brought in after i realized he wasn't crazy he thought he was seeing aliens in a vast government cover up but it was meat you have explained to both me and joel that isaac was enlightened and getting glimpses of the infected in his brain process the only way he knew how as a captain at a corp and came up with most of the ideas the hell just bring them down when i was human i didn't believe in the concept of soulmates i thought it was only something in movies and romance books or love life was a disaster and most men didn't understand my hospital schedule working overnight and sometimes double shifts i was sleeping when they were at work and i wanted to go on dates when i was operating on people,1
B01N11ZWVN,in origin or for that matter indians who are ceos elsewhere in the world or foreigners who are ceos of indian companies the reason for this is that there is something unique about being an indian ceo in india indian ceos have to navigate many mind fields before even thinking of reaching the consumer and once they do the vagaries of doing business in india are so challenging that it takes a lot of courage at times guile perhaps even foresight to get on with what they wish to achieve being a ceo in india today with an overzealous media is not easy indian business persons have also been criticized for being part of a system that is prone to crony capitalism they have lived and worked under the shadow of suspicion where every attempt has been made to denigrate their achievements therefore the first task while working on this book was to highlight those who have built businesses that have inspired people then there is the social cost that a leader and kers india and indians don't take too easily to failure we consider failure as a sign of inherent foolishness or the inability to read things right we don't believe that someone we admire is capable of failure and yet when that person fails we almost revel in his or her downfall one of the biggest highlights of the book is the mantra that success can't be achieved without failure being audacious in business is an enduring virtue and i won't even bother amplifying the cliche that if you dare to dream half the battle is won but that is just a saying and cannot always be true through the role of hindsight is always brought out in books such as these but i have carefully stayed away from this rather romantic notion of doing business hindsight is a good essay subject but not when you're examining the life and times of ceos operating in the real world with real time problems choosing the ceos was tough and to write about them was tougher sunny sending months of rigorous research and burnt the midnight oil night after night to put this together is excellent work in providing the background and then setting the mantras in their rightful context needs to be loaded he has provided the window through which you see the worlds these leaders inhabit and the roles they play off the great profile in this book some inherited their company but left their own indelible imprints on it vocation bunny for example inherited a business empire but what he did to reliance was transformational he moved reliance from an oil and gas corporation to a conglomerate which straddles telecom and retail along with its core businesses i have known mukesh for almost two decades in every interaction with him i have come away with two main thoughts about the men he is a passionate indian and he is an avowed believer in the indian dream when you have people like him helming large corporations you come away believing rather than just admiring mukesh through his mantras suggests that scale of business alone is not enough vision is nothing if not passed through the prism of implementation and consumer connect it is this juxtaposition that we need to examine even in the mantras that mukesh has penned for this book you will see an unflinching zeal for scale and a huge belief in the make in india proposition which is now the birthmark of our current prime minister narendra modi's vision for india incorporated similarly and the mahindra oven munjal and ratan tata among others also firmly believe in the india story ratan tata strode the corporate world like a colossus he is one man who epitomizes the credo that values are more important than valuations the house of tata is no ordinary business house and bombay house is no ordinary corporate office rotten whom i have known for a decade studying in the us and had landed a job at international business machines i b m he happened to come to india to see his ailing grandfather and soon the phone,0

B00938FMQC,possibly refuse the ferries that still apply the hudson river to and from manhattan these days you can also take a train and get there in ten minutes the journey isn't so pleasant in summer but in the winter when the cold is so bitter that you find yourself envying a hibernating tortoise those ten minutes at a treasure this is not a town helped by its climate today when virtually every house and apartment has enough radiators provide warmth in winter and air conditioners to cool the heat of summer the weather plays less of a part in hoboken life than once it did but in the first three decades of the century existence could be hard in a place where snow comes in november and lasts till march and the only refuge from the stifling heat of july and august was to dance in the spray of a fire hydrant by day and sleep on a fire escape by night hoboken has always been an insular sort of place there are still people who have never been further than across the hudson to new york and at least one man who has never even left new jersey although an urban village the inhabitants know each other as well as if hoboken were a farming community in the middle of a kansas plane it is a place where at one time a couple living in sin would have caused as much of a stir as a country town librarian taking a secret lover familiarity has bred by size or at least by the lack of it from the ferry stop or the train station take a taxi to anywhere in town and it is always four dollars hoboken is still only a mile square just as it was when francis albert sinatra all thirteen and a half pounds of him bought his way into the world and confounded the doctor the midwife and not least of all his twenty year old mother donnie dali born natalie katherine guarantee didn't look big enough to carry a sack of potatoes that heavy she weighed no more than ninety pounds no one in the room that day in december nineteen fifteen expected her to survive everyone thought that the baby with a lacerated ear lobe and cheeks along with a punctured eardrum the result of being wrenched out of the birth canal with all the finesse of a plumber's mate using a pair of pliers was dead in fact he would have been had doll his mother rosa who ran a grocery store not also been a part time midwife she held the baby under the cold water tap until he screamed this was hoboken in nineteen fifteen and the city has changed little over the years even if today's gentrified population of thirty thousand boosted as it is by the commuters taking those ferry trips and train rides is only half the number it was the legacy of the past lingers among the few families who still remember this an actress along with the dirt and the squalor and the fights not for nothing was this town the setting for on the waterfront the nineteen fifties marlon brando film of union wars and corruption among the stevedores and longshoreman a movie which almost might have been remembered as the frank sinatra film a story to come later in this tale of the man who is regarded as hoboken favorite son at least by some awesome others have not forgiven him and doubtless never will for what for slighting the town of his birth during his greatest years or just for being the most successful entertainment figure america ave let us begin with his name like almost every frank sinatra story there is more than one version a birth certificate records the arrival on the twelfth of december nineteen fifteen of franks and estero the surname could only have been a misprint when a new copy was issued more than twenty years later the name was changed to francis a sinatra there is no doubt that sinatra was the family name but did his parents later wonder whether francis didn't sound a little nicer than frank and the a was his middle name always albert or did he copy harry truman and later find something to fit an initial in ny eighteen seventy six the matter was made official the officer of the registrar of vital statistics issued yet another birth certificate at this time the name was given as francis albert sinatra the notion that frank came before francis is supported by the fact that although the family proudly spoke about naming the child after the saint his father marty's dear friend and fellow amateur baseball player frank gehrig always said the name was in honor of himself not only that garrick was chosen as the baby's godfather at the christening on the second of april nineteen sixteen appropriately it's in francis's church in hoboken in these facts too there are no more certainties than in

B00BR3NE5W,in toronto's queen's park a large rusty white boulder sits between a huge monument to william lyon mackenzie the rebel who inspired and led the doomed eighteen thirty seven upper canada rebellion and a narrow lane that provides vehicles with delivery access to the ontario legislature thick shrubbery further shrouds the rock from the casual view of passers by it was shortly after midnight on a starry autumn night in nineteen ninety five when i first visited this boulder which is a monument to the canadians who fought for the spanish republic in a bloody civil war that raid aged from july nineteen thirty six to the early months of nineteen thirty nine stray threads of light cast by the street lamps and glimmers of starlight caused mineral deposits in the rock to glitter and gently shimmer sitting cross legged on the grass before the stone i read the official plaque mounted on it's face by the national historic sites and monuments board it read in part art despite their government's opposition more than fifteen hundred canadians volunteered to fight with the republican forces they fought courageously for their ideals suffering heavy losses in major battles the stone was brought to canada by canadian veterans of the spanish civil war they had collected it in the early nineteen nineties from a battlefield near gan dessa in aragon province here many men and women who volunteered to fight in the international brigades had perished in a vain attempt to defend dem mok received from fascism during a war that ultimately proved a dress rehearsal for world war two no one really knows the actual number of canadians who went to spain between nineteen thirty six and nineteen thirty nine most recent calculations but the number at about sixteen hundred rather than the fifteen hundred stated on the memorial almost half of the volunteers never returned coming to rest in shallow graves hastily dug into the spanish earth for several days i had spent many hours in the cbc radio archives listening to the voices of some of the veterans who survived the war i had heard their incredible war stories and thought perhaps i now understood their reasons for going to another people's war those voices echoed softly through my thoughts what the world sixty years earlier was far different from the twilight years of the twentieth century so too were the people in the nineteen thirties canada like most of the developed world was in the throes of the great depression one out of every nine canadians was receiving federal government relief counts plus others were homeless drifting from place to place in search of any kind of work they could find the prairie provinces were undergoing a terrible drought the once fertile fields reduced to dust bowls living in desperate times encouraged many canadians to seek new roads that might lead to brighter futures beside the worn pathways of the conservatism and liberalism both having proved incapable of leading the way out of the depressions chaos to new dramatically different roads were visible in canada as in most industrialized nations many people chose to explore one or the other in one direction lay fascism in the other communism the anti fascist poet novelist and teacher alexander maitland stephen identified eleven fascist organizations operating in canada during the mid nineteen thirties some like the canadian union of fascists were overt in advertising their beliefs others like the shallow foo labour club established in montreal tried to mask their connection to the world fascist movement but shallow fu members showed their true colors when they rallied behind an aldermanic candidate whose election platform advocated hanging a socialist and a jew from every lamp post in the city,0
B00BB0OLY4,greetings from the big lemon formerly known as the city of brotherly love the good news a duke university study officially declared philadelphia number one in the nation the bad news the study had tested which american city had the highest level of hostility ot we out mean the big apple the researchers hadn't pulled me but truth is if they'd questioned me the day of my summer school faculty orientation meeting i wouldn't have skewed their findings ten minutes into our prep session i was skyrocketing off the hostility meter my principal and his verbose inanities had that effect on me so did the prospect of trying to teach in an under air conditioned building through the hottest weeks of the year my face hardened into what from the inside felt distinctly like a glower i have done my share of scowling frowning ng grimacing and pouting but this was my first glower this was big time the face you made when the school doors clanged shut and you realized that while the lucky portion of humanity roasted weenies you yourself would roast in the company of pubescent with whom you had nothing in common except a species designation this was the glower of being unable to remember why it was i had chosen to be a teacher i was never naive enough to be attracted by the pe so what had it been had i really thought i'd make a difference that i could single handedly turn the tide of the twentieth century and make old fashioned non electronic non digital ized objects like books and ideas and written and spoken language valuable commodities again i had signed up for summer school teaching for economic reasons but i'd also been excited by this part curricular program working with teachers from all over the delaware valley and with students from all sorts of backgrounds the exchange of ideas the possibilities of the two months more invigorating but ten minutes into our prep session it was obvious that maurice hammer meyer ph d the principle of philly prep who had as he pointed out written the grant application that funded this program was going to make sure nothing innovative or creative took place i submit to the bench example a the memo in my hand from my leader miss pepper in the light of our mandate to integrate cultural diversity sensitivity throughout the curriculum this summer please be advised that a sufficient number of copies of romeo and juliet are in the book room also we have access to a tape of west side story if you requisition at three days in advance there isn't much in life i can control but surely viewing west side story again hearing richard boehm or pretend to sing maria again was one of those few things english departments are always the designated carriers of culture that's okay with me but now nowadays they've also been appointed societies repair people when attitudes values discipline job application skills etiquette and sensitivity training are required the english teacher is the appointed handy person other instructors teach their subjects we are supposed to teach life and if only we taught a little harder or better all would be well with the world have myers memo implied that he had extended the multicultural mandate to other departments as well although i knew that was a pose what variety of diversity could he dream up for the math a teacher to use both arabic and roman numbers perhaps and were foreign language teachers required to teach languages other than their subject to maintain the pc quotient my leader had avidly pursued this lucrative summer gig during which we became something akin been to a magnet school instead of classrooms filled only with our usual population of over privileged under achievers this summer we also had underprivileged under achievers scholarship kids recent immigrants experimental kids or more accurately adolescents who we're part of a public private educational experiment be careful what you ask for,1

B017J9HNEU,gives a shiver of apprehension and declares now i am in the deepest east what the joke illustrates is how much perspectives of east and west are relative dependent on one's point of departure and prior assumptions now you would think that simply defining eastern europe would be easy a simple matter of getting out a map and drawing a line down the middle of europe but in fact definitions of eastern europe vary usually they run from estonia in the north the chilly shores of the baltic sea all the way to bulgaria in the south at the black sea some twenty or so countries have tremendous diversity in language ethnicity religion and history the reasons for the indeterminate sea of eastern europe and it's shifting borders are ultimately historical this other europe as it has sometimes been called has found itself over the centuries wedged between the series of empires the russian ottoman turkish habsburg austrian and german empires and it is this geopolitical reality that has shaped eastern european history so in a word eastern europe is a strategically crucial location and over the centuries has been a really dangerous piece of real estate in fact few peoples in the region want to be considered eastern european or readily identify themselves as such for example estonians will tell you that they're re really northern europeans are close to scandinavia which is true if you ask a hungarian poll check or latvian they will most often tell you that they consider themselves central europeans czechs point out quite correctly that their capital of prague is actually to the west of vienna austria me meanwhile lithuanians are proud that a geographical commission of experts officially pinpointed the central point of europe in a field in lithuania but there's a whole other series of other rival spots that are also claimed as the center of europe depending on how you draw the lines some people in this region instead insist on it being called eastern central europe which is a very fine distinction a subcategory of all of this involves the label balkan which is also rejected by many in the southeastern european region a key point then is that hardly anyone wants to be in eastern europe this is because eastern europe's past conjures up images of economic backwardness communist repression the iron curtain and periods of intense fragmentation and violence the very word balkanization is synonymous with disorder and ethnic cleansing allegedly uniquely linked to the southern reaches of eastern europe this is a historical experience conditioned by being between massive empires often empires that were contending with one another as a result this area has been fought over repeat the divided and full of turmoil no wonder that people want to get out for western europe eastern europe has also often functioned as a sort of foil the other against which they can define themselves consider one of the classic accounts in popular literature of the other that's bram stoker's eighteen ninety seven novel dracula in which jonathan harker a a young unsuspecting lawyer from england is sent on a mission to transylvania to meet the most famous fictional eastern european of all count dracula heading into the carpathian mountains the lawyer is aware that he is entering one of the wildest and least known portions of europe not even shown on maps and the atmosphere is one of mystery wildness and backwardness harker observes that in this land with many different ethnic groups quote every known superstition in the world is gathered into the horseshoe of the carpathians as if it were the center of some sort of imaginative whirlpool and quote he notes that the farther east one goes the more on punctual the trains little wonder then that he asks himself with a sense of foreboding what sort of place had i come to and among what kind of people the answer of course is that he has landed in the castle of a vampire who will seek to import his evil into the very heart of western civilization britain let's start by listing each of the present day countries we will include in our definition of eastern europe as i just noted this is a contentious issue but will follow a productive criterion of including those countries from the baltic sea to the black sea,0

B008PY0SB4,i stood there on the beach and said goodbye butterfly and the ship slowly turned then headed out toward deep water it would make it back into port at the lighthouse of cabra i knew for that place lay near to shadow turning away i regarded the black line of trees near at hand knowing that a long walk lay ahead of me i moved in that direction making the necessary adjustments as i advanced a pre-dawn chill lay upon the silent forest and this was good i was perhaps fifty pounds underweight and still occasionally experience double vision but i was improving i had escaped the dungeons of amber and recuperated summer one with the assistance of mad dworkin and drunken joplin in that order now i had to find me a place a place resembling another place one which no longer existed i located the path i took it after a time i stopped at a hollow tree that had to be there i reached inside and drew forth my silver blade and strapped to my waist it mattered not that it had been somewhere in amber it was here now for the wood that i walked was in shadow i continued for several hours the unseen sun somewhere behind my left shoulder then i rested awhile then moved on it was good to see the leaves in the rocks and the dead tree trunks the live ones the grass the dark earth was good to smell all the little smells of life and to hear it's buzzing humming chirping sounds god how i treasured my eyes having them back again after nearly four years of blackness was a thing for which i lacked words and to be walking free i went on my tattered cloak flapping in the morning breeze i must have looked over fifty years old my face creased my form sparse lean who would have known me for what i was as i walked walk in shadow move toward a place i did not reach that place it must be that i had grown somewhat soft here's what happened i came upon seven men by the side of the road and six of them were dead lying in various stages of red dismemberment the seventh was in a semi reclined position his back against the mossy bowl of an ancient oak he held his blade across his lap and there was a large wet wound in his right side from which the blood still flowed he wore no armor though some of the others did his grey eyes were open though glassy his knuckles were skinned and his breathing was slow from beneath shaggy brows he watched the crows eat out the eyes of the dead he did not seem to see me i raised my cowl and lowered my head to hide my face i moved nearer i knew him or someone very like him once his blade twitched and the point rose as i advanced i'm a friend i said would you like a drink of water he hesitated a moment then nodded bs i opened my canteen and passed it to him he drank and coughed drank some more sir i thank you he said as he passed back my only regret it was not stronger than this cut i have some of that too if you're sure you can handle it,0
1528857143,we'll have to do and perhaps that wasn't completely wrong his inner voice kept repeating how important it was that he took care of it like a mantra it was how things were intended that and nothing else was the real point of all his wandering after a number of attempts he managed to hit the envelope with a stone and catch it before it hit the ground it was dirty and full of small tears and looked as if it had survived the end of the world against all odds it was also heavier than it expected all doubt had now blown away god had chosen him this was not just any old envelope he inspected both sides for clues but found nothing other than a name written in small sprawling letters asia shahin saladin has a sat down on a stone and laboriously sounded out the name but it meant nothing to him after some hesitation he took out his knife and carefully slit open the envelope unaware that he was holding his breath he pulled out and opened the letter examining the long rows of handwriting it was hebrew that much he could tell but he could barely read arabic so how would he be able to understand this what was god trying to say was he punishing him because he never learned to read or was the letter not intended for him at all was he only an insignificant middleman whose sole purpose was to pass it along he tried without success to dismiss that disappointment while he folded the letter and put it back in it's envelope he continued his wandering northward towards azure one where he reluctantly bought the ladder in a mailbox many would surely think that khalid sure idk had behaved shamefully and was deeply immoral he on the other hand did not feel guilty at all when he picked up the envelope without a stamp sender or complete address letters where the sender had failed to do their part became his property it was a practice he had applied without exception during the forty three years he had worked sorting mail at home he had many boxes filled with stray letters one for each year he liked nothing more than fishing one out at random and studying the contents that were meant for someone else this particular envelope was something out of the ordinary the oxidation confirmed that the journey itself must have been an adventure moreover some one had already slit the envelope open but left all the contents inside for him and no one else exactly ninety eight minutes earlier than usual tallied sure abca arrived home and locked the door he had skipped afternoon tea even though he'd brought her esa cakes and jogged the whole way home from the bus now he was out of breath and could feel the sweat trying to penetrate his tight polyester shirt dinner could wait instead he poured a glass of wine from the bottle hidden behind the books on the bookshelf sat down in the armchair took out the envelope and solemnly coaxed out the letter finally he said to himself reaching for the wine blissfully ignorant of how the blood clot which had been building up in his left leg for several years loosened and followed them blood flow all the way up to his lungs even though it had been more than a year since maria's uncle died from a long embolism she still had not set foot in his house the two brothers had challenged the will and on everything they could to pressure her to refuse the inheritance even her own father had tried to convince her arguing that khalid sure afk had gradually lost his mind over the years and had left his house in disarray he also didn't think women would ever be able to manage property but maria held our own and now finally she could put the key in the lock and go inside in the negotiations she'd become estranged from her brothers and pp parents the house would be cleared out and sold and with the money she could afford to quit her job at the tailoring shop moved to amman and start working her dream job at the jordanian national commission for women it shouldn't have been possible there was really nothing to suggest that the letter would ever reach its recipient with all the obstacles the probability was so slight it was impossible to calculate yet that was exactly what happened one year four months and sixteen days after the letter had been pushed through a crack in the prisoner transport vehicle and taken hold of by the winds and the black knights it ended up in maria sure abkhaz hands a few hours later she had succeeded in piecing together most of the missing information though three sleepless nights,1
B005I5MDCU,so what are you working on at the moment they would ask politely a book about middle age i would say and whoever i was speaking to would give a terrible sort of roguish bridal or squirm and say not that you'd know anything about that of course without exception they said it men and women young old and middle aged mm sells a beautiful young writer to notting hill party said it sweetly a red faced old farmer at a point to point said it with creaking flirtatious everyone seemed to think it their duty to reassure me that i was exempt from what they obviously thought of as a kind of bad spell which was odd prose forty seven when i began writing this book not a borderline case but as unambiguous an example of female middle age as you could possibly imagine the other thing they all wanted to know was how are you defining middle age i wasn't convinced that defining middle aged was a useful exercise for women and it is female middle-aged that concerns me here male middle age is certainly a very interesting subject but not one about which i feel qualified to write the menopause is the unequivocal marker of the boundary between youth and what is left of life cross that frontier and you are in no doubt that you are middle aged but middle age and the maniples are not precisely the same thing fashion journalists and doctors would place the onset of middle age will be for the end of fertility at the point at which one's rate of egg production and cellular renewal begins to slow on one's ability to wear hot pants and biker jackets with conviction to diminish i was more interested in describing the defining this passage of female experience in particular because low middle aged people now predominate in the uk popular nation in two thousand and nine the average age was thirty nine and a half years with the graph showing a large peak of baby boomers in their forties and fifties as i approach middle age myself i could find no contemporary model of it that interested me throughout my adult life i had been accustomed to find my own experience as a woman reflected in the culture magazines and newspapers contained pictures of women have more or less my age dressed in clothes that i might also like to wear describing experiences that were familiar to me programs on the television and radio took us their raw material the lives of my contemporaries in bookshops the female experience appeared in a myriad narrative forms until the onset of middle age when all of a sudden there was apparently no one like me at all like the children of hamelin led away into the mountain cavern we had all vanished i exaggerate there were if you looked for them some traces of middle aged experience to be found in newspapers and magazines these generally took a sternly prohibitive form in my twenties and thirties i read magazines in which the features of fashion shoots described a world of possibility and fantasy but at forty and beyond there were no fan should shoot only grim lists of the garments one could apparently no longer wear without appearing grotesque together with much shorter lists of suitable alternatives all designed to conceal or restraint,0
B00DB6HGXY,his misconceptions about what this peninsula are known to most of us as turkey and are are shared by many americans and many moderns in the west or asia minor or turkey has played a historic role it's often seen as the bridge between europe and the middle east or really it's more proper designation near east and that's a role that everyone more or less accepts but our visions of this land are really colored by a number of misconceptions that go back to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries a turkey was the home of the historic foe of christendom the ottoman turks the terrible turks besieged vienna and f fifteen twenty nine and sixteen eighty three a turkey became synonymous i in the uk writings of the authors of the enlightenment with despotism it was right after france in the opinion of people such as voltaire and dita row ah in the late nineteenth century it was dubbed the sick man of europe that was a term that was dubbed buy em tsar nicholas the second and who better would know a sick empire than the last tsar of the rushes are all of these images have contributed to modern conceptions about turkey and asia minor and this is seen in pulp fiction had seen in films a one can only remember the various spy novels that were current in the us period of the cold war and particularly the james bond films are from russia with love i think believes below begins in the cistern of justinian underground where he's zipping around in a motorboat really quite bizarre sequence and then emerges some someplace of for a reception likewise miss midnight express another notion of what turkey is all about was filmed in the cistern of justinian as a prison and these these sort of images are all part of what i would call a phenomenon orientalism this rather romantic notion of what the peninsula is about a turkey is where muslims live air go it must be a desert air ergo it must be similar to what you see in lawrence of arabia ah and modern turks today are very perplexed when asked about where the camels might female turkish friends sometimes lead on americans by saying oh yes i was reared in a harem and i escaped and now i'm a perfectly normal normal modern person they these are issues that we're not going to talk about in this course to a large extent what we do plan to talk about are the various civilizations on this peninsula starting with early neolithic villages are some of the earliest farming communities anywhere in the world notably at chatel who yuck in holyoke is the turkish for a tel a mound that are quite frequent in the middle east i write down through the classical periods the byzantine periods to the early ottoman empire where this course will conclude in the early sixteenth century what i think i can show is that there is a remarkable continuity in the various civilizations that have occupied this peninsula that the native peoples who inhabited a turkey or asia minor are a veritable mini match rainy and in a way are each contributed an each gave a dimension and to the various influences and civilizations that entered the peninsula and that there are successive civilizations yes they are different you will see christianity you'll see an ottoman muslim period and yet there's also a certain continuity that reaches all the way back into that earliest period and that's in a way why i chose to work in this region i am by training a classical historian my interest is on greece and rome off foremost my interest is in the transformation of the classical heritage on into the early christian byzantine world that is what i have devoted most of my academic research to but in the process of studying in turkey in trying to find out that decisive moment where we move from the classical into the early medieval i realized that i was only studying a small portion of a much greater continuity continuity a continuum that starts with neolithic villages goes through the bronze age of the hittite empire to succeeding i iron age civilizations to the greek impact to the great roman impact on the peninsula the roman empire it's transformation to the byzantine christian world and then finally with the arrival of the turks in the eleventh and twelfth century into a muslim era into a into turkish civilizations and really you'll see that there's two f phases of this turkish civilization the medieval celtic and the early modern ottoman so what our plan is is to lead you through these civilizations where you can see the differences and the continuity our focus will be on the classical age,0

B07887SM4B,as he got closer he noticed two other girls standing in the shadows it was apparent that back who was the first officer to arrive at the scene was a little shell shocked she appeared to be desperately in need of reassurance even in the dim lighting marty could see that the pint sized rookie's face was ghostly white with a slight green tint she looked as if she was trying hard to keep whatever she had for dinner from making a reappearance he couldn't really blame her it was too easy to recall puking in some bushes at a gory crime scene not that long ago patty what do we have marty asked as he tried inconspicuously to shine the flashlight across the faces of the three girls he pegged them to be most likely high school age grabbing hold of the crook of marty's arm officer back turned to the girls will be rough right back please try and relax just stay right here she turned back to him it's bad detective keel real bad she turned on her flashlight establishing a bright lcd path ahead of them and she led the way toward the tree line the sound of the weeds and small rocks beneath their shoes seemed to echo throughout the woods each crunch beneath their feet felt magnified tenfold as they walked down an overgrown footpath officer back stopped abruptly causing him to bump into her there she pointed with her light a few feet ahead marty followed the ray of the young officer's flashlight with his eyes he could make out a small body lying face up surrounded by a mound of broken twigs and weeds naked from the waist up the small exposed white breasts assured him that his first assumption that it was a female was correct he shined his flashlight slowly up from the torso toward her head which lay at an angle facing away from them something seemed to be placed over her face because he couldn't make out any of her features he walked closer in order to get a better look marty's f first thought was that someone had placed a blanket over her or that she was wearing a mask of some sort but he wasn't sure he finally understood as he caught a strong whiff there was no mistaking now there was no escaping the distinct odor of burnt hair and flesh there was no mask and there was no blanket whoever this was no longer had a face instead there was just a charcoal mass of melted skin and muscle tissue marty turned back to officer beck who was kneeling now head between her knees trying hard not to be sick he walked over and knelt next to her his large palm gently rubbing her tiny back hey you okay he asked as he tried to swallow some bile of his own she nodded as her top teeth bit down on her bottom lip it reminded him of that thing that hope would do if she thought she were going to start to cry do you know who she is patty marty asked her still rubbing her back do those girls know who she is his hand rose and fell as he felt her inhale and exhale they said that she is a friend of theirs they all came up here together and she got supper narrated from them they went looking for her and the sound of backup vehicles arriving caused them both to let out sighs of relief come on marty led her back down the path to where they had left the three girls he could see the other officers and crime scene investigators exiting the their cars as they reached the opening of the woods somehow he managed to go on autopilot and began the task of directing crime scene techs and officers to maintain the integrity of the crime scene this was his first major case and he knew that this would make or break his reputation as a hamas side detective he was determined to do everything right yet there was more at stake here than his reputation everything he did from this moment on would be key to finding the animal that murdered the girl now lying faceless in the woods he prayed silently that gene would arrive quickly he knew that there was nothing better than the voice of experience,1
B00MWCCXNQ,i have never had to wear a hit job the idea of frightens me a little the shapeless cloak somber colors and layers of scarf wrapped around my head and neck garments so obscuring they seem to create even a labored particular walk at best i imagine i will look severe and unkind at worst i fear i may disappear entirely i have managed to avoid it until now even in yemen there i had stayed with six women the alkhateeb sisters who wore head to toe black including veils across their faces and dark gloves to cover their hands yet each morning as we took turns checking ourselves in the tall mirror that hung in the corridor they insisted upon my elbow length sleeves and bare ponytailed hair when i tried to cover my head or don a shawl before going outside they closed in around me brushing away my attempts saying no it is good this way with their fierce swaggers shrill voices and readiness to make a scene of something displeased them they made for powerful guardians as we move through the narrow darkened alleys of eastern sunnah squashing ourselves into the creaky public minibuses that took us to the market i follow the indications of their long black covered fingers as a pointed me to a new seat every few stops a near constant adjusting and readjusting of places to ensure no woman suffered the indignity of sitting next to a man she wasn't married or related to as we picked out fish rabbits or chickens that squawked and fluttered as they were thrown onto the scales they whispered warnings of the times they had been insulted by the stray glances and roaming hands of sonars bachelors who spent much of the afternoon sitting on flattened cardboard boxes in the streets shewing the handfuls of green hallucinogenic leaves they stuffed into their mouths and wedged in their cheeks in their small white tiled kitchen the sisters observed a strict pecking order the youngest and most recently married peeled garlic and scraped carrots while the oldest twenty four with three children already commandeered the groaning chinese food processor she fed it handfuls of green chillies tomatoes and coriander to make the fiery the oog we dip boiled eggs into for a snack under the layers of black cloth that were shed and flung into a corner the girls revealed the indoor versions of themselves faded jeans fitted leggings and baggy sweatshirts saying frankfurt or university of los angeles their skin was smooth and almond colored and their thick hair fell in loose curl ls around their faces their veil muffled voices became loud and crisp it felt strangely intimate to see them this way the shapes and textures of their hair the red lipstick on their mouths the fact that some of them preferred pink t-shirts to blue things few men would ever see from morning until mid day the alkhateeb kitchen was a busy hub of reaching arms tasting spoons and fingers flicking water or oil across eager surfaces one sister sizzling pan awaited another's pad of clarified butter and heaping spoonful of hawaii spices a third sister stretch do across a conical straw pillow while a fourth brush the surface with beaten egg and scattered sesame seeds jars of cardamom were tipped calendars of rice were washed and chicken was hacked into neat pieces on a slab of wood balanced on small plastic stools unlike their kitchen duties the care of their ten young children was interchangeable and every mis timed leap over the cushions piled in the living room demand for a glass of warm milk with rosewater or scorched ne from an overeager approach to the blazing tumour could send any of the sisters running i imagine they had expected me to be older and probably lazier but i worked hard for my intrusion into their lives far beyond the thousand dollars in crisp banknotes that i had paid into the hand of the elders of the alkhateeb sons in exchange for hard currency i had been promised two weeks of being permit to trail them everywhere they went and to be placed firmly at the center of all their cooking and feeding activities the youngest who by virtue of being the last born had been spared an early marriage,0

B073DG5FYX,one from the diary of mr sherlock holmes friday twenty first october eighteen ninety eight the telegram said only man found on more in nightshirt please come on the train watson said what on earth could have possessed a man to go wandering around the moors in such a state homes can you be a lunatic you know my process watson it is a capital mistake to theorize in advance of the facts even i cannot be expected to develop a reasonable hypothesis based on six words he fell silent but i knew he was merely framing his next question as the train pulled into clap em junk one station it came you must have formed a theory homes he said my frown did nothing to discourage him he is too used to me by now i suppose to take my aloofness at face value i said i have formed seven hypotheses that broadly cover the little that we know until i have facts i cannot determine which is the most likely for instance sometimes the man is like a child his need for entertainment is really very amateur crowd delighted from the train and dispersed on the platform they were replaced with another crowd waved goodbye and puffed and panted through the carriage in search of their compartments i have never seen a duller group of travellers what i am a criminal instead of a detective no form of public transport would be safe from me it is fertile ground for the picking of pockets and the taking of lives holmes watson urged again for instance i cannot determine how the man came to the moors until i know where exactly he was found all i can determine is that he is alive and incapacitated watson's face fell into that comically bewildered expression that usually irritates me only because i know that most of the time he pretends and ignorance he does not in fact possess in this case i knew i had truly amazed him i wrapped my coat closer around me and buried my head in my scarf wait a minute he cried you cannot leave it at that homes come my dear watson you have as much information as i you can draw your own conclusions surely silence reigned for ten delicious minutes as and then he said the man were capable of speaking rationally he would have given the police some sort of explanation if that was so they would not have consulted you precisely another few moments and then but how can you be sure he isn't dead my dear watson i said exasperated if the man were dead they would have said they had found a a corpse or a body they describe him as a man ago he is still alive so he may prove to be a mental patient if he is unable to give an account of himself possibly but i think not there are several mental hospitals in devonshire most of them around the exeter area of memory serves isn't possible this poor fellow escape from one of them unlikely at his continued bewilderment i added for two reasons in the first place the police would surely have checked the local institutions to determine if a patient were missing in the second it is customary in such facilities i believe to dress the inmates in institutional clothing the fellow is f found in his nightshirt oh i deterred him from further speculation by ruminating on the mathematical probabilities of being struck by lightning within twenty minutes my oratory had the desired effect dr watson was asleep inspector pendleton met us at the st david's station in exeter a short stout man with the skin of a former tin miner he seemed greatly relieved by our presence would you like to see the manifest mr holmes he said or should i take you to the area where he was found i would like to see the man i replied what is his condition then he is gibbering i'm afraid he makes no sense he cannot even tell us his name is he a lunatic escape from one of the asylums watson said i know i have asked he is not from a hospital nor is he from the jail where is the man now i asked i brought him to the station he's in one of the cells,1
B07CP4M2WX,somewhere in my parents' house there's a picture of me at age seven and crouched in the grass in the backyard on a summer evening surrounded by fireflies lifting my cupped hands as if i'm holding a secret and want to share at that age it's easy to be amazed the world is new and you're new in it and free from the ridiculous certainty that ca come so easily with aid that the inner workings of the universe are not only knowable but already known my first interest in magic came long before i became a magician and though i have gone on to perform my show thousands of times for hundreds of thousands of people to this day when i think about magic i think about two memories from a time before i knew anything about tricks the first was when i lay on the floor under the piano when my dad played before bedtime during the day he worked as a dentist but we rarely saw him at the office we saw him when he came home and painted in the basement or paste the backyard with a yellow legal pad writing terse fiery letters to the editor of the local paper about public policy and the environment he'd read them to us at dinner and my mom would invariably protest art you can't see say that in public and my younger brother and i would laugh in delight at her exasperating but in the evenings he would turn out the lights and sit at the piano and i would lie underneath listening the only light in the room came from the lamp for the sheet music beethoven bach rachmaninoff the music filled the house but from underneath i could hear the mechanics of the piano to the faint creak of the pedals the click of the keys the felt hammers striking the strings the deep resonance of the sounding board you could get lost in the sounds from the most expensive concert grand to the cheapest church basement conquer a piano is essentially a wooden box stretched with wire it's a cumbersome piece of furniture and as i listen all those nights before bed i realized that the majesty in the mystery of the piano is at this heavy ungainly apparatus can give birth to the moonlight sonata that you can coax from this box of wood and wire a sound so light and pure and beautiful that anything so firmly rooted in the physical could call into being something that borders so closely on the transcendent this lying on the floor underneath my dad's piano was the first time i really know notice the experience of magic the second came maybe a year or so later one night my mom came upstairs to wake me and my younger brother it felt like midnight but it was probably only nine or ten she held my sleeping baby sister and asked us to come downstairs dad had already started the car and put blankets on the back bench seat and we set out into the night on an adventure they said we lived in ames iowa a small liberal college town surrounded by endless stretches of corn and soybean fields in fifteen minutes out of town on the two lane highway we were beyond the reach of the city's light and enveloped in total darkness the entire world was reduced to the faint illumination of the dashboard and a short smudge of yellow from the headlights on the road ahead we pulled off the highway onto a gravel road dad turned off the engine and we all got out on either side of the road the corn rose above my head and the warm summer wind breathe quietly through the stocks i stood there expectant i imagined and uncertain why we had come and then i looked up this was not the sky i had seen the sky i knew how the sky looked at night and this was some different thing entirely the comforting veil of faint stars that mildly wrapped every other night had been replaced by a void of terrible space and time and distance stretching infinitely up and infinitely away forever there was mars there was the milky way there was the universe and all of it's awful overpowering majesty towering above us inexplicably high and distant hostile and beckoning dangerous and while a haunted place where we were the only ghosts for miles,0

grey possess the land but here and there spots of bright blue reveal lakes and a shining dazzle of white shows the location of alkali plains a little snow appears in the scene but it is we remember midsummer the land knows snow in it's season having satisfied his curiosity with an impressionistic glance the observer must now view the country more systematically from east to west along a line following roughly the center of the landscape from the peaks of the continental divide upon the eastern horizon high plateau countries scattered with mountains extends westward one hundred miles to the few log huts which form the trading post of fort bridger in the next hundred miles west of the fort in the present state of utah lie the wasatch mountains lofty rugged and forbidding they are in most places bare of trees except along streams for they are mountains which face a desert just westward of their base lies of the great salt lake itself a sizeable and very brilliant spot of blue with a wide alkali desert running off from it's south westward in a white shimmer for five hundred miles westward from that salt inland sea stretches done and heat stricken under the summer sun the arid country of the great basin which forms now the state of nevada a monotonous succession of mountain ranges is this land's most noticeable feature treeless of dark volcanic rock sometimes sinister and reds or tawny yellows as yet nameless these ranges run north and south at almost regular intervals as the sun moves their shadows swing from mm west to east across the great empty sagebrush valleys between them afternoon looks only morning reversed it is a thirsting land small meadows with springs fringe the bases of the mountains but dust storms blow over the plains and rivers are few the humboldt dreariest of streams threads from east to west between the desert ranges stretching out toward the truckee descending from the sierra nevada but humboldt and truckee alike disappear and sink some salt lakes and forty miles of desert lie between them at the western edge of this arid country rises suddenly the sheer wall of the sierra nevada at it's foot that drab color ends and the mountains stand forth notable by the rich green of forests the blue of lakes the white of snow and the clear shimmer of high wind swept a granite the sierra and it's foothills form a belt one hundred miles wide and westward of them is the sacramento valley of california now in mid summer stretching away mellow and golden with it's ripe grasses and in the valley the water from the sky may see also the adobe walls of sutter's fort between bridgers and sutter's the only mark of civilization is a tenuous trace winding from east to west and for a portion of the way swinging off to the north into another region it is a faint pair of parallel lines the track of wagon wheels on the california trail even now far upon his right the water may mark the emigrant trains most of them have just come into view their white wagon tops a gleam as they did bush from south pass at the continental divide some are for oregon some for california and even all bound for one destination i'll not follow exactly the same route but all who are for california must at last descend the winding way to where the humble dies in the sand then they must reach the truckee go up it pass the blue glitter of truckee lake and finally,0

B00VHN3114,waiting on an alaskan honeymoon cruise what a shocker i should have read this evidence sooner as it would have eliminated some of my confusion i replaced the note and regarded marion my heart started thumping again as i admired her i was half tempted to return to bed and do a little reconnoiter ring under the sheets but it was unfair to interrupt her peaceful slumber instead i decided to take my daily constitutional and explore some of the byway ways of seattle i hadn't been here since the eighties when ronda and i took two weeks to drive up the west coast and back i remembered eating some good seafood and visiting the space needle i found a room key card on the desk and dropped it into my pocket then i hung a do not disturb sign on the outside handle and check the number by the door noting i was on the seventh floor so i know where to return then i mosey down the hallway to find an elevator the ride down to the lobby was uneventful without even being subjected to elevator music i emerged into a pleasant room containing a fireplace surrounded by bookshelves flower patterned couches a glistening black baby grand piano and a potted palm tree even a slightly worn grey carpet who made it look homey i nodded to the desk clerk and headed toward the door at that moment a man juggling a large metal box with a tv like screen on top shot out of a side room here let me hold the door for you i said as he charged out toward the sidewalk i followed him out but by that time he had disappeared around the corner young people always in so much of a hurry when they reach my heights and geezer land they'd slow down i crossed the street and turned back to lock in the image of the lincoln hotel a green awning over the lobby green canopies over second floor windows and the red brick structure reaching up twenty stories or so i accosted a man in an overcoat and asked which way to the bay he pointed down the street and i followed his directions after half a dozen blocks i spied a sign that said pike street fish market the street was bustling with people carrying baskets and bins and setting up food at long counters inside an open air market building crates clattered laughter echoed and the aroma of bacon wafted by damn i was hungry but i'd wait until i return to the hotel to eat anything and then marrying and i going to have breakfast together while we renewed our acquaintance i turned at the crunching sound of crushed ice being poured into one of the stands i watched as seafood was placed on the counters crab fish clams i passed a large metallic pig that looked like a piggy bank on serious steroids i padded it's cold surface there was actually a slot to put coins in but i didn't have any change with me as i strolled along the street watching the early morning collection of vendors and tourists a man emerged from a doorway he wore a tattered brown flight jacket and had a red bandana wrapped around his head he stopped in front of me and i noticed a large mole on his left cheek can you spare some money for a disabled vet before i could answer a man in an apron and holding a broom emerged from a shop mob along lumpy i've told you not to bother people in front of my store lumpy muttered something i didn't hear and then turned to stumble down the street mumbling as he went i continued along the street and came to a park that overlooked the harbour the sign indicated this was victor steinbrueck park i wonder do the hedgie was people sat on benches and i ambled over to a railing to look over a lower level of roofs toward a cruise ship moored alongside appear i suspected that might be the one waiting for me it rested there three times the length of a football field shiny white with a dark blue smoke stack and white radar gear poking out on the top it looked large enough to stay afloat and keep my feet dry i liked the idea of a crew choose except for the fact that i hated the ocean oh well i'd be fifty feet above the water unless they stuck us with one of those lower level porthole rooms i looked up at a totem pole where two pigeons rested on a wing like protrusion on the sidewalk below them accumulated some of their little gifts,1
B07CTZCTSR,boggs and danny both hovered over a certain area of the floor where the area rug had been moved back i could tell they were listening boggs held a palm up indicating that i should stay back i could hear my own pulse and dani's breathing like the guy's crouched before me i listened intently a faint and short lived splash came from beneath us danny looked up and met my eyes with his eventually he unlocked his gaze with me and peeled the area rug back farther with the movement of the rug came another splash this time louder something beneath us was moving a chill ran up my spine and out of instinct i looked around for anything that might be used as a weapon i also reached deep into my mind searching for anything that might present itself to me on a primal level it was there but what it was exactly was unclear i found myself wishing there were more of us in the room but knew that nathan and susan would only be in the way i wanted abby far from here whatever was below the floor was evil of that i was sure we were lacking in supplies and weapons with the loss of gas came the loss of one of our greatest resources a leader with strength i had become so accustomed to sharing my thoughts with him that without thinking or meaning to i reached out to him it wasn't in words it was just a sense of desperate need for him of course he didn't answer back my heart sank the pain too much to bear i had avoided thinking about my love my soulmate knowing but when i finally allowed myself the privilege it might very well break me to a point beyond repair before i realized they were doing it bogs and danny cracked open a panel in the floor the underlying scent of mustiness instantly mingled with that of rot and nose biting vinegar immediately the sound of splashing escalated and was accompanied by a low tone growl what the fuck grumbled boggs zoe stay back he had already raised one hand out to warn me back and covered his nose and mouth with the other danny took a defensive stance a couple feet away from bogs the splashing sounds had quieted but the growling continued what is it i whispered i am not sure said boggs as he turned his flashlight on and shined it into the space beneath the floor his face paled and i was sure he was about to vomit a split second later my prediction came true as he spilled the meager contents of his stomach into the opening on the floor the mess landing somewhere below with an echoing splash the growling changed tone and became a hissing sounding very much like a warning to keep back i walked forward the worst that could happen would be death and by that point i was ok with death for a moment i even considered blindly walking into the hole and just getting it over with as boggs wiped his mouth and danny moved forward toward the hole so did i then he took his own flashlight and shined it into the abyss i leaned forward but boggs held me back gently you don't want to see this though he said after clearing his throat no i need to i answered firmly the stench was growing unbearable i looked down following the beam of light from denny's flashlight which flickered twice it's in the back left corner said boggs there is a set of wooden stairs leading down into a room that looked just tall enough in which to stand the floor was slanted and covered in stagnant water it was too dark to determine just how deep it got boggs give me your light i said no way he said i'm not asking i heard him sigh when i reached an open hand out for the flashlight never taking my eyes off of the depths of the room eventually i felt the cold shaft of the small metal light in my palm i gripped it with my fingers and found the on off switch with my thumb i aimed it at the hole before turning the beam of light on,0
B005797KIY,best of the best in the undergrad literature program at jasper now on the first night of the semester they waited anxiously for their professor to emerge on the screen the class was lit for twenty four unraveling a literary mystery it had been offered at night because this was the only viable time the only hour when the warden would allow the murderer free to teach he would teach if you believe the rumors from a padded cell other said he would be in front of a green screen with special effects to replicate a lectern before him an illusion of a classroom the rest claimed he would simply be shackled to his chair in an orange jumpsuit because state law prohibited anything else they had to remember what this man had done these people said they had to remember who he was the room was warm with the closeness of bodies the chalkboard seemed to glisten even though the vermont night outside was bitterly cold the quads were mostly silent save for the protesters who stood the stipulated two hundred yards from culver hall where the night class would be held the class met in the basement of culver for the the reason the powers that be at jasper did not want the protesters to be able to see what was happening on that tv screen the few students who were out at that cold hour witnessed the nervous candlelight of the protest vigil from a distance through the cops of beech and oak that dotted the woodsy campus a light snow fell flakes rushing upward in the january wind like motes of dust not far away lake champlain purred in the wind it was as if one freshman said as he looked down at the scene from a high dormitory window some one were about to be executed just beyond the protesters in a building that was dark save for a few bottom floor lights a pair of state policemen sat in a room the size of a broom closet drinking coffee and watching their own blank feed on a tiny screen unraveling a literary mystery this too had been contested the president of the college chose the title because it sounded to him fitting for what the professor had in mind but in fact the president did not know exactly what the class would entail he could not know the murderer had only hinted at a literary game is students would play in the class about his syllabus he had spoken to no one it was this inability to even guess at what was about to happen that silenced the classroom now in the weeks before the semester had begun when they went home to their families on christmas break the students who had registered for lit for twenty four had time to think to weigh their decision to take this strange course they wondered if something could go wrong in that lecture hall if their professor could somehow but sounded crazy yes most of them did not say it aloud or if they did they spoke only to their roommate to their closest friends slight whispers torn away by the wind carried off into nothingness if he could somehow get out this was what they were thinking in those final seconds some of them talked about their other classes that semester flipped through textbooks and highlighted paragraphs and trembling arcs of yellow but mostly they sat saying nothing they stared at the dead television screen they wondered and they waited finally the television went to a deeper black and everyone sat up straight then the box began to hum an electrical no dish booing a kind of flatline that moved left to right across the room their professor the macarthur winning genius once a shining star at nearby dumont university and the closest thing to celebrity a professor of literature could possibly be the same man who had viciously murdered two graduate students twelve years before was ready to appear then the blackness dissolved and the noise died away and the professor's face came to them on the screen they had seen pictures of him many of them preserved in yellowed newsprint there were images of the man in a dark suit at his trial or with his wrists shackled and smiling wolf actually moments after the verdict or with his hair swept back wearing a tweed jacket and a bow tie his faculty photograph had dumont and nineteen eighty those photographs did not prepare the students for the man on the screen this man's face was harder it's lines deeper he was in fact wearing a simple orange jumpsuit the number that identified him barely hidden beneath the bottom edge of the screen the v of his collar dipped low enough to reveal,1
B002UZZ7NI,it'd been like a second youth he had gone abroad as a middle aged widower still grieving for his lost wife and also as a semi retired politician who had to push himself to savor new experiences but the magic of france had quickly enveloped him making years that were his forties seemed like an enchanted span from say twenty five to thirty at the time it had not mattered so very much that his flirtations had been platonic though it took an effort to keep from seeing this as a series of defeats his justified confidence in his writing skills blinded him from realizing that his love letters were ponderous and even tiresome possibly spoiling the opportunists eighties that might have been but nonetheless there had been moments of titillation in the relationships and his mind returned to these euphorically now as he disembarked in norfolk he was startled to learn that newspaper accounts had already told the public that he was to be secretary of state everyone he met on the dock bowed and called him mister secretary president washington was so anxious to have him accept the job that he had sent several letters one had been handed to him before he left the ship one dated october thirteen caught up with jefferson when he reached the inland town of abington virginia on december eleven four days later as he continued toward his monticello home a copy dated november thirty seventeen eighty nine reached him in the town of chesterfield jefferson quickly responded but with an unusual delaying tactic he wrote that he was truly flattered and honored by your nomination of me to the very dignified office of secretary of state this was followed by a dozen lines that stressed how poorly qualified he was and the stranger the predictive words that he foresaw the possibility that this may and disagreeable lie for me but he added it is not for an individual to choose his post and my inclination must be no obstacle by thus leaving the decision in washington's hands jefferson caused the president to write another letter in january that would reach him at home early in february seventeen ninety meanwhile another bit of pressure had been exerted when jefferson's friend james madison came to welcome him home but also to press washington's case and urge jj jefferson to accept which he finally did on february fourteen seldom has anyone been pressed so hard to accept a highly desirable political office and yet jefferson's foreboding was meaningful the appointment would prove painful both for him and for washington to begin with the president's offer had come as a mixed joy and sorrow to jefferson to be secretary of state and clearly the senior among washington's advisers was a high honor holding the unspoken possibility that it could lead to the presidential office in four or eight or twelve years what a triumph slap at those who persisted in claiming that his role as virginia's governor had ended shamefully and fleeing from british raiders if general washington showed his approval who could say a contrary word who else knew as much about the art of retreating but was this step back to politics the life he wanted his inner voice probably cried know many times but just as often responded to a new and contrary ambition that said not yes but perhaps why this conflict jefferson had dreamed of returning to his beloved monticello improving the farms around it to strengthen his troublesome finances altering his house according to the gracious neoclassical examples he had grown to love in europe living quietly with the books and friends that pleased him most after five years of virtual freedom from supervision in france and the surrounding countries he had visited with such an avid appetite for learning and beauty washington's letters seemed more like a call to harsh duty than an invitation it was reminder that he would be expected to reside wherever the government might choose to set this still undetermined capital to attend meetings whenever someone else called them and to think more about the advice he would owe to the president than about the much larger world he had seen whose main cities exceeded half a million in population but he must have been conflicted for this newer thought taking his mind in the opposite direction had to be considered the presidency he did not wanted for personal aggrandizement but for a chance to lead the nation toward the glowing future he had in mind and away from what he saw as a looming,0

146909696X,you can do in these gray situations is to listen to these concerns and tried to address them the best you can first and foremost by asking your team members for suggestions on alternate ways of tackling them sales is sometimes like that we say what we have to say to make the sale up to a point at least certainly not encroaching on anything of a legal nature the expedient exaggeration of the truth or l wl little white lie is part of the game the buyers know this as everyone knows this your company's product is always going to be better than the competition even if it's not a pharmaceutical rep is always going to downplay the side effects of a new wonder drug as extremely rare and cite the case study stats what dummy salesperson is going to say otherwise but here are examples of the types of sticky ethical situations millennial salespeople must grapple with one during a phone conference a buyer insists upon the product arriving in their warehouse by april first or the deal is completely off the previous day the vp of operations had openly said in a meeting there's no way in hell it's getting there before april fifteenth the sales leaders answer to the buyer on the phone no problem we'll make it two a millennial rep tells his sales leader that the team's number one salesperson wrote an inappropriate email it had an off putting tone not have a harassment nature to someone in another division of the company the sales leaders answered to the employee thank you for letting me know i'll dig into it three a young salesperson gets a total skip on a product from a key buyer in a panic he calls his sales leader from the parking lot and asks what should i do the sales leader tells his rep go back in there right now and say that you can't accept anything less than one thousand units tell her you'll get fired without the order all three of the aforementioned scenarios actually occurred with different people and indifferent companies guess what in each of the three situations the sales manager was right to varying degrees one after the meeting with the buyer the sales leader who lied shoots straight toward the office of the vp of operations and begs him to shave off two weeks of production time so they can make the buyer's deadline they work together and figure out how to make it happen to the sales leader follows up as promised and it turns out that the rep was correct the email had an inappropriate tone the sales leader gives the former number one salesperson a severe verbal and written warning and instructs him to apologize to the recipient an email is sent to h jar documenting the incident along with evidence the sales leader also personally calls the person on the receiving end of the offensive email and apologizes on behalf of his employee three the rep goes from the parking lot back to his buyer's office he tells the buyer the sad story that he needs the order or else he'll lose his job the buyer feels bad and purchases the target quantity all of those scenarios ended the way they should right not exactly in each circumstance the millennial rep saw his supervisor as a bad leader huh but doesn't the result matter most well let's take another look at each scenario from the rep's perspective one the only thing that sticks in the mind of the rep is the false date given to the buyer it doesn't matter that the sales leader knows from experience that he can finesse the schedule with the vp of operations and make it work after the fact he is going against a specific statement made by the vp of operations two the rep assumes the sales leader has led the number one salesperson get away with bad behavior he goes to colleagues in hr to complain about the sales leader playing favorites he has no idea that behind the scenes the sales leader is holding that person accountable for his inappropriate re behavior and that he smoothed over the situation with the offended party three the rep receives the order possibly but feels that either a his job would have been truly in jeopardy if he failed or,0
B002V5GT2K,i go yes she said i suppose we should say goodbye she turned her gaze as best she could well she said goodbye sparky will probably never see each other again later he said i'll never get over that scene as long as i live and indeed he could not down to his own dying day it was certainly the worst night of his life the night of my greatest tragedy which he repeatedly put into the terms of his passionate sense of an fulfillment that his mother never had the opportune shitty to see me get anything published he saw her always from a distance and as the years went by with each stoical retelling the moment became more and more iconic it was safely frozen in time as puzzling a farewell in it's quiet cool-headed resolve as the lines spoken by the mother as she prepares to lose her son in citizen kane i've got his trunk all packed i've had it packed for a week now frequently often publicly sparky laid out the terrible resigned paphos of what his mother had said to him that night only as he got older and experienced parenthood himself would he understand the pain and fear she must have had thinking about what was to become of me the blizzard had brought everything to a halt but the train drummed on across st paul and landmarks familiar even in the snow slipped past his window alerting him that his own neighborhood was approaching then there it was for all to see mud brown two story brick buildings huddled along his snowbound street from where the great northern railway overpass crossed north snelling he could see down to the selby intersection two blocks to the south where since monday he had sleep walked through funeral arrangements with his father and his family's rented walk-up eve even before this week of calamities he had considered this part of st paul the setting of my most influential section of life as a child above the buildings to his right a greek pediment had entrance marked the huge elementary school he had attended he could see dayton avenue a side street among whose small somber dwellings carlin dena had lived in nineteen twenty one during the first year of their marriage and next door the roof under which his father had sheltered the family during the great depression some of the lonelier years of sparky's childhood and this scanty backyard where the kooky puppy spike living in his own world had gobbled up some glass they're on the corner of selby and snelling was their streetcar stop whence came among his earliest memories the image of himself getting aboard with his mother a small boy on a stiff cane seat off to the department stores the trip downtown was easy the streetcar free and airy full of light on the return trip the car became crowded saturday was the big shopping day in st paul package burdened passengers flocked in to fill every seat when the next woman or girl appeared it was standard procedure for a young man even a small boy accompany being his mother to get up for her sparky observe this courtesy although it meant that he had to struggle to keep by dina sighed first one new passenger then another displaced him as the car swayed this way and that and with each additional surge of homeward bound shoppers at the major intersections they were pushed farther and for farther apart finally he lost sight of her altogether and from that moment on was locked in his terror imagining as clearly as if it had already happened that when the streetcar glided up it's double rails to their corner she would forget him and step off by herself leaving the trolley to carry him away trash apt and alone in later years he would ridicule the idea that his mother would have forgotten or overlooked him she would never have done that she was not by nature absent minded indeed the record shows the dina was an attentive even fussy caregiver to her only child but no matter what happened to charles schulz for the rest of his life even when he married and started a family and became known as a cartoonist then was lionized as a figure of national wisdom a philosopher king beloved by millions a seer revered to the point of idolatry his standing measured in four decades of unremitting worldwide recognition as one of the most beloved artists on earth he felt unseen he never stopped believing that he had been forsaken and would be left behind that nobody cared as a boy he had been loved by his mother or so he insisted but dena halverson scholtz had a remote quality she could be distant cool elusive mocking and a little scornful and she was foxy by nature,0

B00S1YOWMY,something like these failings that the author of the following sketch presents his narrative to the public he can claim no titled ancestry nor lordly birth to throw around in a fictitious glory this tale draws it's interest from the wild scenes of war and the wilder passions of men souls which it has been his fortune to encounter it is his hope both to instruct and amuse the young that they may better prize the blessings of pace and learn that war with all it's glory is to be dreaded not sought for that it is productive a far more evil than good even to the successful party and that it should ever be to all nations only a last resort from the most flagrant oppression i was born in den dog in the county of loath ireland in june seventeen ninety three i was the youngest of eleven children six of whom were sons and five daughters my father's name was charles o'neill and my mother's maiden name was alice mc gay my father was a carpenter by trade and he supported his large family by daily toil he was an industrious and active labor and in other times would gladly have seen his family settle around him pursuing the peaceful applications of wh husbandry or engaged in some of the more useful mechanic arts but it was our fortune or misfortune i should say to live when all europe resounded to the din of arms and to the glory of martial life amid the confusion and carnage of battle napoleon the mightiest of heroes and conquerors was then rapidly ascending to the zenith of his glory and all the crowned head of europe terrified by his growing power and anxious to save themselves and their thrones began to prepare themselves for resistance recruits were sought for in every village and hamlet the honors of the soldiers life and the glory of the military profession were everywhere and by all classes of people the topics of con procession fathers and mothers were careful to instill in the minds of their children the glory and honor of a military life and the fair young damsels of our one day island for island has charming and beautiful girls were scarcely willing to regard any young man as honorable all brave who did note a last name to does serve well of his country he is a soldier he is fought in such a battle he belongs to his majesty's regiment etc will rip your passport to society and respectability all other occupations were considered time and spiritless fit only for the aged or infirm and for cowards my father caught the spirit of the times and although two out to engage in such an enterprise himself gave his ready permission to arthur my oldest brother who early sought to distinguish himself on the field of battle my mother's consent was not so readily given but even she did my no means object to his new enterprise and when he presented himself before his parents in the new uniform for their parting blessing she felt proud that her son was possessed of such a noble courageous so she tearfully gave him her hands saying go my son cover yourself with glory in the service of your country and when you are old you will be honored respected and provided for but alas how little did my mother think that the first news she would hear from our firstborn son after this blessing would fill her own heart we grief unutterable he enlisted into the navy and was placed upon a seventy four gun ship named the terrible and terrible indeed a proved to him for he was killed by a cannonball a few months only after enlisting in an engagement which took place in ninety no seven near the coast of holland between his majesty's fleet and the fringe name evil force his death was a severe affliction to my parents and completely dampened my father's desire for military honor for his children it was therefore with deep regret that they saw in my brother james's mind a growing dislike to the quiet duties and occupations of home and an earnest longing for those warlike scenes which had been so fatal to offer this desire sued and grew so strong that entreaties and persuasions were alike useless for my dear and aged parents and in less than two years from arthur's death he enlisted in the royal army of george the fourth in the ninety sixth regiment of foot it was a sorrowful day in our little home when the news came that his regiment was ordered abroad into foreign service my father gave him much good advice with many directions for the attainment of the owner he hoped to see him enjoy at some distant day,0
B00GAAWG3I,our day will surely come may i be there to see i exclaimed devoutly but you are speaking of this man pollock ah yes the so called pollock is a link in the chain some little way from it's great attachment pollock is not quite a sound link between ourselves huh he is the only flaw in that chain so far as i had been able to test it but no chain is stronger than it's weakest link exactly my dear watson hence the extreme importance of pollock led on by some rudimentary aspirations toward right and encouraged by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten pound note sent to him by devious methods he has once or twice given me advance information which has been of value that highest value which anticipates and prevents rather than avenge his crime i cannot doubt that if we had the cipher we should find that this communication is of the nature that i indicate again homes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate i rose and leaning over him stared down at the curious inscription which ran as follows five hundred and thirty four c two thirteen one twenty seven thirty six thirty one four seventeen twenty one forty one douglas one o nine two ninety three five thirty seven birthstone twenty six birthstone one nine forty seven one seventy one what do you make it with homes that is obviously an attempt to convey secret information but what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher in this instance none at all why do you say in this instance because there are many ciphers which i could read as easily as i do the apocrypha the agony column such crude devices amuse the intelligence without fatiguing it but this is different it is clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book until i am told which page in which book i i am powerless but why douglas and birthstone clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page in question then why has he not indicated the book your native shrewdness my dear watson that innate cunning which is the delight of your friends would surely prevent you from enclosing cipher and message in the same envelope should it miscarry you are undone as it is both have to go wrong before any harm comes from it a second post is now overdue and i shall be surprised if it does not bring us either a further letter of explanation or as it is more probable the very volume to which these figures refer holmes calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the appearance of billy the page with the very letter which we were expecting the same writing remarked holmes as he opened the envelope and actually signed he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the epistle come we are getting on watson his brow clouded however as he glanced over the contents dare me this is very disappointing i fer watson that all our expectations come to nothing i trust that the man pollock will come to no harm dear mr holmes he says i will go no further in this manner it is too dangerous he suspects me i can see that he suspects me he came to me quite unexpectedly after i had actually addressed this envelope with the intention of sending you the key to the cipher i was able to cover it up if he had seen it it would have gone hard with me but i read suspicion in his eyes please burn the cipher message which cannot be of no use to you fred porlock home sat for some little time twisting this later between his fingers and frowning as he stared into the fire after all he said at last there may be nothing in it it may be only his guilty conscience knowing himself to be a traitor he may have read the accusation in the other's eyes the other being i presume professor moriarty no less when any of that party talk about he you'll know whom they mean there is one predominant he for all of them but what can he do that's a large question,1

B00V7AZ7TQ,when i left for turkey i instructed my landlord that bombard was to be allowed into my flat during my absence he had agreed to attempt a preliminary sorting of the papers i had also opens negotiations with two american publishers of textbooks of psychology who showed themselves interested in chi carroll vitamins papers then for some months i thought no more about psychology for the problems involved in the dating of the battled figurines absorbed my full attention reich had established himself in the laboratories of the turkish uranium company at diyarbakir his main concern so far of course had been the dating of human and animal remains by the argan method and in this technique he had become the foremost world or authority in turning his attention from the ages of prehistory to the reign of the hittites he was exploring a relatively new field despised his own work was concerned man is a ian years old the hittite invasion of asia minor occurred in nineteen hundred bc for this reason he was delighted to see me in diyarbakir for my own book on the civilization of the hittites had been the standard work since it's publication in nineteen eighty for my own part i found reich a fascinating man my own mind is at home in any period from twenty five hundred bc to the end of the tenth century a d reich's mind was at home in any period from the carboniferous age onward and he could speak of the pleistocene a mere million years ago as if it were recent history i was hp present once when he examined a dinosaur tooth and he remarked casually that it could not possibly be as recent as the cretaceous age that he would place it in the late triassic about fifty million years earlier i was also present when a geiger counter verified his guess his instinct for this kind of thing was quite uncanny since reich will play a considerable part in this story i should say something about him like myself he was a big man but unlike myself his bigness owed nothing to surplus fat he had the shoulders of a wrestler and an enormous prague nathan jaw his voice always gave surprise for it was gentle and rather high the result i believe of a throat infection in childhood the main difference between myself and reich lay in our emotional attitude towards the past reich was a scientist through and through for him the figures and measurements were everything he could derive enormous pleasure from reading through a column of geiger readings that extended over ten pages his favorite assertion was that history should be a science now i have never tried to hide the powerful element of the romantic in my my composition i became an archaeologist through an almost mystical experience i had been reading a volume of the civilization of ninevah by lad which i had picked up casually in the bedroom of the farm at which i was staying some of my clothes were drying on a line in the yard and a burst of thunder made me hurry outside to get them in just inside the farmyard there was a large pool of grey water rather muddy as i was taking the clothes from the line my mind still in nineveh i happened to notice this pool and forgot for a moment where i was or what i was doing there as i looked at it the puddle lost all familiarity and became as alien as a c on mars i stood staring at it and the first drops of rain fell from the sky and wrinkled it's surface at that moment i experienced a sensation of happiness and of insight such as i had never known before nineveh and all history suddenly became as real and as alien as that pool history became such a reality that i felt a kind of contempt for my own existence standing there with my arms full of clothes for the remainder of that evening i walked around like one in a dream from then on i knew i had to devote my life to digging up the past and to trying to reconstitute that vision of reality,0

B079SPVPKD,the sea broke out in prayer and began to recite the five sorrowful mysteries of the rosary hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus as one the watchers returned her chant the tight single bedded room no bigger than a prison cell filled up the song of voices overwhelming the stuttering rhythm of sonny's lungs holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death the south sound boomed off the ceiling off the whitewashed walls the concrete floor the glass cover of jesus our savior reverberating louder and louder filling every orifice hail mary full of grace the lord is with thee blessed art thou amongst women and blessed is the fruit of thy womb jesus holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death verse after verse prayer after prayer keening for years as a child in one gloomy catholic church after another i recited that prayer running the words together like a hollowed verbal conjuring trick until i could say holy mary mother of god pray for us sinners now and at the ara death in four seconds flat words breathed but emptied of meaning now i was home on the island off the coast of ireland's poorest county mayo and the farthest western reaches of europe for the hour of this death home on an island of elemental fury a rock citadel in the great ocean where huge atlantic storms break on shore scouring the landscape and destroying everything not anchored down the wind howling wailing car door wrenching at night as you lie in bed awake the storm surging in assault striking at the rattling roof the shaking windows to suck you out every living soul within up into the maelstrom the great ocean one hundred yards away was alive and malevolent the surf a cascading white fury the waves lashing every headland surging turning daring you close enough to capture you for the debt my godfather a shepherd and two of his companions were swept to their death rescuing sheep on what had started as a clear winter's day and with the wind comes the rain bucketing drenching rain for months on end swallowing the ocean the air the hills the horizon in a biliary gray stinging assault pouring pouring from the sky in deluge black mile high sheets of falling water sweeping in from the western horizon bursting on the sodden earth before roaring back down heather hillsides into the ocean the sky to another vast ocean often gray or darkening black with rain laden clouds but sometimes pink scarlet red or blue or shimmering with light a sun lands pillars of gold brushed through an overcast sky onto grey waters or the air filling up with miss showers and the whole world see sky earth glimmering back in a mirror of silverlight and then there are days when the sun blazes as a god chariot rising from behind men on mountain over the ocean in a great arc before descending in a blood red orb into the ocean behind crone mountain yellow lilacs rocket skyward from the bog and meadow sway with golden buttercups and white daisies the sea turns green glass the wind stills and dolphins leap in surf so close to shore you could easily swim out to them like a smoky perfume the smell of peat turf laser he drifts over the village and the blue eyed sheepdogs of duca nella deliciously spread themselves on the tar and gravel road to cool their molten bodies as sonny lay dying we had another kind of weather humid hazy days the entire village consumed and see mr we were unable to see further than the garden gate oh land sea,1

B003SAZ1GW,plan and take it in doses and you'll get hooked on the benefits the hardest thing to do is just get started it takes change and sacrifice it takes walking away from your comfort zone and changing the way you view your job it takes personal growth that raises your self esteem is up to you to decide when to start and what to do there are plenty of strategies in this book to improve your attitude but first and foremost it's self help now if all this seems obvious that's great what books have you read tapes have you listened to or seminars have you attended lately to beef up your attitude knowing what to do as easy doing it is tough if you've been doing it keep it up if not get started and quick taking the time to fortify and grow your attitude takes a refocus on daily priorities and disciplines you can't wait to find the time to do what's most important you have to make it it's up to you eu to start making the time grave diggers if the first step to changing your thinking and attitude is fortifying your mind with motivational ideas and thoughts the second step is being selective and protective of the other daily influences flowing into your mind on a minute by minute basis growing and maintaining the right attitude as as much what you keep out of your the mind is what you put in it this book has a series of disciplines to keep you focused on your success all of these steps work especially when cumulated together and used on a consistent daily basis they will take root faster and create more value if you keep the grave diggers away grave diggers are forces we encounter every day that slow our progress and have the potential to wipe it out completely we call them grave diggers because they have the ability to bury your career your future and ultimately bury you alive soon after anyone begins to get ahead and rise above the crowd grave digger zero in and begin to tear down if preventive measures aren't taken first let's identify characteristics of grave diggers and their actions at every workplace in the world there are negative people possessed by negative attitudes living mostly unimed inspired and miserable existences they go to work to wait for something to happen in their careers and in their lives for the most part they have no goals little ambition and spend most of their time justifying being average by blaming everyone and everything else based on the way they criticize and find fault you'd think they were being paid for it to all outward appearances they seem to be pretty nice folks on the inside though they're miserable misery loves company and if anyone starts to excel or pass them by grave diggers turn into piranhas chewing them up and trying to bring them down to their level this group would rather dish discuss then decide anything they'd rather study the race than ever join the race they're filled to the brim with excuses to explain away their lack of achievement they think that everyone more successful than they are has had all the breaks and are content to wait indefinitely for theirs to come most of this group shows up at the job every day without a visa then a plan or a peep of what might happen that day they hold their breath rely on what cards they're dealt hoping that one day four aces might just show up for the most part they know they're going nowhere fast in life but they're more comfortable with old problems than they are with new solutions new saloon oceans would mean change and grave diggers are so blinded by the cost of doing something change that they lose sight of the cost of doing nothing the cost of doing nothing is staggering both for the grave digger and for the company employing them to do it we sometimes make the mistake of believing that if we don't actively associate with grave diggers at work and just listen to but don't partake in their cancerous conversation or actions they were safe from their effects after all we don't want to offend anyone and what harm is there if we just nod sympathetically while they rattle off their negativism passively listening to their gossip and self justification surely that's not hurting anything wrong just being around grave diggers is subliminal poison for the attitude it's like secondhand smoke just being in the same room with it can make you sick it gets anya in your clothes and into your hair and lungs even after you leave the smokey area you still have it on you and in you you smell like someone else's problem even though you weren't the one smoking it's a proven fact that secondhand smoke will eventually kill you grave diggers eventually kill your career and your future look for a support group,0
B01N4KZCKO,the flying father they called him and boy was he flying now he risked a quick glance at his special watch and felt a thrill as he took in the figures his split times were amazing this morning surely a personal best stick this in your pipe and smoke it lim he thought pace eight miles an hour heart rate a tad high but surely nothing to worry about three more kilometers out of ten left to run but they were the easy three flat along the riverbank by the meadows only the hard uphill dogleg through march means woods could possibly slow his average now days like this when the running was fly ooo it easy effortless were rare and unpredictable no amount of training made them happen more often they came out of nowhere and he knew by now not to question them just enjoy this feeling he thought for it is a gift from god and he's not been giving much to me lately if only liam could have joined him this morning liam understood the numbers liam would have shared his joy ah well if liam cannot be my witness then it shall have to be god amun thought god is infinitely good and what a weekend to celebrate his goodness in just an hour's time shower our shaved his mind emptied of all matters of the flesh amen would be celebrating good friday mass with the nuns at the church of st francis good friday the most solemn of days in the christian calendar and yet the harbinger two of the most joyous day easter sunday many time times over the years he had questioned his calling his faith he'd not been the only one to do so either indeed the bishop recently seemed to have made it a personal ambition to have aim and defrocked but each time one of the great landmarks of the ecumenical calendar rolled around easter christmas day palm sunday the thrilling drama and mystery of the event reminded him that the priesthood was the only life he could ever lead although in truth at times it seemed he lived two lives as a priest on the one hand the shepherd of his flock ministering to their every spiritual need and on the other the flying father of the internet tunnel marathon circuit raising hundreds of thousands of pounds for the poor and the needy and the lost and then of course there was that her other life he lived the secret life he kept so tight so close that few if any knew of it god is forgiving he also believed but no now is not the time to think of that he emerged from the trees and turned hard right onto the gravel path which ran alongside the river the air down here smelt sweet and clear he lifted his head high to take in the beauty of the spring morning the sun had only been up an hour and the meadows sparkled with juve miles up on the far hill the village sheringham slumbered still a late lie in being taken by one and all on the first day of the holiday weekend he could see the cotswold stone of the houses glowing warm in the rays of the rising sun he heard a sound behind him on the river and still running turned to see a pair of swans coming in low to land in the way water by the moored barges the birds seemed to hang in the air beside him and for a brief second he thought he could feel the thread of god's creation binding his own running figure to the swans to the waters to the meadows and the orange rising sun then the swans hit the water and he pushed his pace higher and left them behind his body felt on top form this morning the muscles of his legs flexing painlessly his breathing strong and unforced sixty two years old and fitter than half the men in sheringham he thought the drugs he was on for his heart were a miracle indeed but a scientific one no matter what stresses he faced there was no danger now of repeating that awful moment last autumn when he'd felt his chest lurch and his pulse race and he'd heard the communion chalice crashed to a stone at his feet and it had all gone dark no science was keeping him alive though of course the almighty had a small say in that too is this what it feels like to be truly happy he thought i sure as heck don't deserve it as his feet pounded a rhythm on the muddy towpath he tried to corral the worries that had plagued him this last week that had woken him each morning in a cold sweat and forced him onto his knees on the hard stone of st francis his church to pray for guidance they're like demons,1

B01M1ORYM3,to some extent that's the reason i have to ride my novel so quickly after a few days what i call the state of grace threatens to abandon me and my characters whom i believe to be very much alive the day before suddenly have become strangers i have just spent nearly a week with the photographer and editor for image then with an english journalist the superiority of photographers to most journalist i've often observed them when at cannes for example lady send in a bunch almost in a swarm on their victim they seem hard cynical almost cruel they offer an hour and a roar shots demanded of them they're used to all kinds of dramas and above all to all sorts of truths actually they do have a good deal of contempt for their victims a false smile a studied pose fake nonchalance and phony sincerity don't deceive them perhaps that's the reason why they can appreciate the truth better than anyone else so they really seem grateful when you don't try to fool them to give them a chance not to be tough the match photographer who lived four or five days in the bosom of my family had not known me before he came but left as an old friend the writer theoretically more cultured but who managed to ask hundreds of impertinent questions came to do his work no more and add an article a victim to his collection why do we receive them and give them our precious time when we might be relaxing not for reasons of publicity for these always inaccurate articles risk wearing the reader out and even little by little turning him against an author still less out of vanity i don't mind explaining myself to a man who is trying to understand and whose opinion means something to me but that isn't the case with ninety nine percent of those journalist especially magazine editors give it a beginner or a freelance writer for whom this article could be important i'm sure to remember my own beginnings and give him his chance but what about the others so thoroughly smug who think they know it all that they are judges of everything can solve all questions they arrive at an author's house having read only a few of his books some time ago or even having read only one on the train or the plane each time however i have hope a hope of finally correcting legends destroying exasperating myths getting rid of continuing untruths there is none i always answered the same questions and i end up feeling sickened how does the idea for a novel come to you then what do you do what time do you begin writing on a typewriter or by hand how many hours a day how many days her now i in turn must ask myself a very disagreeable question for thirty years now since the beginning of the migrate i have given the same answers for they have to be the same if i were suddenly to declare which would be untrue that i begin to write at midnight or that i dictate my old answers will be printed just the same names from the telephone book index cards outline on a yellow envelope the coffee i make in the kitchen i follow this whole routine because i believe it is necessary if i am to set off the mechanism so much so liberties become a superstition and if like the readers of magazines i too am a victim of legend if i have begun to believe in it by the sheer force of seeing it in print what stops me from writing at eight o'clock in the morning instead of at six or six thirty from not writing a whole chapter at a sitting the proof that it's possible is littered can when i was convalescent and unable to follow my routine i wrote lewis entirely by hand several pages in the morning several pages in the afternoon without worrying about the length of the chapters and without making myself read copy them on the typewriter afterward to give my sentences a sterner rhythm it wasn't i but my wife who typed glofish and this novel is no worse than the rest it isn't even different from them then why did i go back to my routine right afterwards because of saying over and over that this bothers me i'm tempted to escape the rules i have imposed on myself isn't it stupid not to dare the ritual i've adopted is as strict as the mass i don't know why and i've tried to explain it because i've been asked to do so i've succeeded so well at it i've proved so many times that it was necessary,1

he is out of it all these weeks since the abbot was summoned to winchester but robert's rule is less favoured by the rest of us i couldn't tell you how long is it he's been away now pondered huh seven or eight weeks the legates keeping his court well stocked with might as all this time maintaining his own state no doubt gives him some aid in confronting hers not a man to let his dignity bow to princess henry and he needs all the weight he can get his bag he's letting some of his cloth dispersed now however said cat file a by that token he may have got a kind of settlement or you may be deceived into thinking you're has father abbot sent word from reading in a week he should be here you'll hardly find a better witness bishop henry had taken good care to keep the direction of events in his own hands calling all the prelates and mitred abbots to winchester early in april and firmly declaring the gathering of a legate in council no mere church assembly had ensured his supremacy at the subsequent discussions giving him precedent it's over archbishop theobald of canterbury who in purely english church matters was his superior just as well perhaps cad file doubted if the aboard had greatly minded being outflanked in the circumstances a quiet timorous man might be only too glad to look peaceably in the shadows and let the legate bear the heat of the sun i know it once let me hear his account of what's come forward down there in the south and i can make my own dispositions were remote enough here and the queen god keeper has gathered a very fair array now she has the flemings who escaped from lincoln to add to her force she'll move heaven and earth to get steven out of hold by whatever means fair or foul she is said huh with conviction a better soldier than her lord not a better fighter in the field god knows you need to search europe through to find such a one i saw him at lincoln a ma novel but a better general that she is she holds her purpose where he tires and goes off after another quarry they tell me and i believe it she is drawing her according closer and closer to london south of the river the narrow arrival comes to westminster the tighter that noose will be drawn and is it certain the londoners have agreed to let the emperor sin we hear they came late to the council and made a faint plea for steven before they let themselves be tamed it takes a very stout heart i suppose to stand up to henry of winchester face to face and deny him allowed cad files sighing they've agreed to admit her which is as good as acknowledging her but they're arguing terms for her entry as i heard it and every delay is worth going to me and to steven if only said huh the dancing light suddenly sharpening every line of his intent and eloquent face if only i could get a good man into bristol there are ways into castles even into the dungeons two or three good secret men might do it the fistful of gold to a malcontent jailer kings have been fetched off before now even out of chains and he is not chained she has not gone so far not yet cad file i dream my work is here and i am but barely equal to it i have no means of carrying of bristol too once loosed said cad file your king is going to need this shire ready to his hand he turned from the brazier hoisting aside the pot and laying it to cool on a slab of stone he kept for the purpose his back creaked a little as he straightened it in small ways he was feeling his years but once he wrecked he was spry enough i'm done here for this while he said brushing his hands together to get rid of the hollow worn by the ladle come into the daylight and see the flowers we're bringing on for the festival of st winifred father abbott will be home in good time to preside over a reception from st giles and we shall have a house full of pilgrims to care for they had brought the reliquary of the welsh st four years previously from good erin where she lay buried and installed it on the altar of the church at the hospital of st giles at the very edge of shrewsbury is forget suburb where the sick the infected the deformed the lepers who might not venture within the wall those were housed and cared for and thence they had borne her casket in splendor to her altar in the abbey church to be an ornament and a wander a means of healing and blessing to all who came reverently and in need this year they had undertaken to repeat that last journey to bring her from st giles in procession and open her altar to all who came with prayers and offerings every year she had drawn many pilgrims this year they would be legion a man might wonder said hugh standing spread footed among the flower beds just beginning to burn from the soft shy colors of spring into the blaze of summer whether you are not rather preparing for a bridal hedges of hazel and may blossom shed silver petals and dangled pale silver green catechins round the enclosure where they stood cow slips were rearing in the grass of the meadow beyond and irises were in tight thrusting bad even the roses showed a harvest of buds erect and ready to break and display the first color in the walled shelter of cad files herb garden there were fat globes of peonies to just cracking their green sheaths cad file had medicinal uses for the seeds and brother petrus the abbot's cook used them as spices in the kitchen a man might not be so far out at that said cad file viewing the fruits of his labors complacently he perpetual and pure bridal this welsh girl was virgin until the day of her death and you have married her off since it was idly said in revulsion from pondering matters of state in such a garden a man could believe in peace fruitfulness and amity but it encountered suddenly so profound and pregnant a

B00BAZDEB6,it was major wellman who informed me that i had volunteered for a new unit called the first combined regiment we were in the middle of a training operation i had been assigned as an instructor in advanced infantry training at fort campbell for the past six months ever since i finished my medical leave following the debacle on denson my ranger battalion had been there for a joint training mission with a devo tect battalion the war had caught us all by surprise and denson just happened to be the first target the alien federation hit and brother they hit us hard of the twelve a hundred humans on the planet only three hundred survived the attack and two thirds of us were wounded it was a miracle that any of us got off didn't send alive the devo attacked battalion we had been training with got hurt worse and they had nowhere to go it was their world,0
B00LB7EX8G,not long before we had that fateful meeting at the model agency in victoria my mother had an adenocarcinoma removed from her adrenal gland i knew she'd had surgery but i was too young to understand what it was all about as far as i was concerned she'd had a tumor and the doctors had cut it out end of story she was my mother she was invincible in my eyes invincible later i would find out from my father that the doctor at royal jubilee hospital's cancer clinic had shown her an x-ray of the tumor it was as big as an orange in nineteen ninety less than two years after having the cancer removed from her side my mother was diagnosed with multiple myeloma an uncommon cancer of the bone marrow there were no available drug treatments the only known treatment was a bone marrow transplant from a compatible donor in this case her brother auto the doctors warned that there was at least a twenty five percent chance the treatment itself would kill her and the likelihood of a cure was unknown multiple myeloma is more common in older men and they diagnosed her late despite her earlier brush with cancer so this is what she faced at forty three she can endure a grueling operation that might well kill her or die in terrible pain as her bones disintegrated and her organs failed a grim death that might take months or years in her position knowing what i do now i don't honestly know what i'd choose but my mother when faced with this terrifying choice was brave and determined to be there for her girls and for her husband of twenty five years she opted for what was at the time an experimental treatment my mother was one of the first one hundred patients in the world to be treated for multiple myeloma with a bone marrow transplant she was in hospital for two long months then i tried to keep up with school during that time but with my parents on the mainland at the hospital i was distracted to say the least with my frequent trips across to vancouver general hospital my school attendance dropped dramatically and eventually the school decided to pass me through my eleventh grade exams based on my good previous marks and attendance record several times a week i traveled between vancouver island and the mainland on the ferry my sister and i had to put on sterile gowns and scrub ourselves with disinfectant before being allowed to visit our mother the ward was full of young kids fighting leukemia and i remember feeling so fucking guilty to be so healthy that bone marrow transplant was a brutal way for my mother to die she was hooked up to tubes and a respirator unable to leave the hospital room largely unable to walk my loyal father who had always had back trouble slept on a cot beside his wife every single night for two months he would not leave her side when she slipped into unconsciousness ravaged by the treatment and the complications no longer able to breathe on her own we all held hands around her swollen body and i see you listening to the machine that made her lungs work keeping her alive i'll always remember the feel of her hand as i held it it was hot and puffy like a balloon the smell was so strange like she was filled with chemicals she'd lost her hair and eyebrows and her swollen features were indistinct the sound of a respirator can still reduce me to shakes we left the room eventually and my dad stayed with her to hold her hand when i turned the machines off right until the end i thought it had to be a terrible mistake there was no way she could die she just couldn't it was impossible to consider life without her at the memorial i wore her favorite floral laura ashley dress which has hung in my wardrobe ever since never to be worn again it is bright and cheerful she wouldn't have wanted me in black her parents my oma and opa stayed in a separate viewing room throughout the service unable to face the crowd the mourners my sister then nineteen retreated into her own grief but for the first few months after my mother's death i shadowed my father unable to let him out of my sight i dragged him to the beach with me to the pool to the shopping mall the two of us took a trip up island to fino where we'd always spent summers as a family lie sometimes in the night i would hear my father weeping the sound was soft creeping like damp through the walls of the family house a house that suddenly seems so empty it was as if it were a different place entirely no longer a home,1

B006VOWPR0,he walked out into the one hundred five degree summer heat he was six feet tall weighing in at two hundred and twenty five a handsome dude with thick black hair gelled up into an elvis presley quaff his girlfriend krystal a petite exotic filipino and portuguese blend was waiting outside in a bmw sedan tony welcomed the blast of air conditioning that struck his unshaven face as he slipped into the passenger seat what he was hoping for was a letter from joe roy metheny inmate two seven zero eight nine six currently serving two life sentences in a maryland prison without possibility of parole tony had been pressing methane theni to tell him about unsolved murders bethany's mail was easy to spot because he always drew a cartoon on the outside of the envelope just under the return address the first time methane he had written tony had been surprised at the prisoners artwork had made it by prison censors and u s postal service inspectors but after several years of uninterrupted correspondence had concluded that no one really paid attention timothy news childish cartoons his drawings always featured the antics of a round faced baby with an oversized head and toothless grin it was methane his trademark character a serial killer's mickey mouse as crystal maneuvered the bmw north onto rainbow avenue tony held up methane is envelope for her to see is from joe he announced excitedly a kid with a candy bar while don't open it yet crystal chided the mom telling him to wait for after the meal tony had promised his parents chris and aussi uglier that he wouldn't read any of the letters from serial killers unless one of them was present although tony was thirty two years old he still lived with his parents as he had his entire life tony examined the envelope searching the drawing for a clue but then he had used colored pencils to sketch his cartoon baby a cone shaped party hat was strapped to it's cue ball head and the infant was clutching a giant burned matchstick in his left hand and a cupcake in his right flame flickered from a single candle stuck into brownish pink icing a birthday greeting i see it he announced to crystal who was focusing on traffic methane he always hid some gruesome image cleverly inside his drawings and now tony saw it methane he's grinning baby was not clutching a birthday cupcake at all what he was clutching was a woman's severed breast the candle was rising from the graphically erect nipple it was typical of athene inside internet chat rooms and on serial killer websites but then he was known as the cannibal killer a reference to how he had dismembered his female victims and served their ground up body parts to unsuspecting diners at a roadside barbecue stand in maryland he prided himself on being the real hannibal lecter life imitating art and he had a small cult following on the web among self proclaimed devil worshippers and serial killer devotees do you know how much i could sell this for on the internet tony asked crystal just as quot likely he added i never will of course joe knows that i would never do that of all the serial killers that tony corresponded with methane he was the most callous and graphic in describing his sexual debauchery there was a cold blooded nis about him that astounded his family when one of crystal's friends died from cystic fibrosis tony wrote a short story about how angels had carried her to heaven he'd sent copies to methane he and his other serial killer pals nearly all of them wrote back and told him that his story was touching except methane e your story brought tears to my eyes methane he wrote sarcastically come on tony you're going to have to do better than that if you want to make me to cry tony had been upfront,1
1984841963,from backstage i watched the tape run for the last show his introduction i always assumed it was tape even though it probably hadn't been for years tape is a thing of the past a relic redundant exactly how i should have felt at that moment my time was up i had done ten years it was someone else's problem though i should have been sad even just a little a touch of bittersweet melancholy at least i had certainly experienced those feelings on the run up to the show's ending but in that moment i wasn't sad not even a little bit it felt like the last day of my grim high school i was elated i felt the fog clearing finally i'd be able to see the horizon get my bearings and continue the journey the tape ended and both drummers thundered out the beat i walked out wave to the audience and claimed on top of that fucking desk to sing the last song i stomped and time doing what i've always tried to do attempting to follow the beat while trashing the varnish i have never thought of myself as a late night talk show host i've said that often to anyone who would listen but i suppose it was a bit confusing since all they knew about me was that i hosted a late night talk show the press was convinced that i was crushed not to be taking over for david letterman when i left the late late show in twenty forty him despite my public insistence since two thousand and five when i started in late night often quoted in their very publications that i didn't want the job i didn't and i don't you can check this one lane if you want although i can't think why you'd bother at this point certainly nobody seemed to find it nessa seri at the time it seems to me that people make up stories to fit their perception about you they don't just do it to me of course it happens to everybody i do it to myself i'm getting older now and the shadows are getting longer when i look into them i see shapes move and stir and i think i remember what they are but maybe i'm just making it up to suit a reality about myself that i find comfortable from january two thousand and five until december two thousand and fourteen i hosted a late night show an american broadcast television i phoned it in turns rewarding frustrating difficult easy immensely satisfying soul crushingly dull hilarious and depressing sometimes ellen one show so sometimes all in one monologue sometimes all in one interview i've never really thought of myself as an interviewer but if you talk to people on t v and the short title has your name in it then you are by default an interviewer i suppose the strict traditional format the show was produced under demanded that each episode begin with a monologue a late night tradition dating back to the early rat pack a nicotine e alcoholic mad men days of tv my first stumbling attempts were the clumsy reading of jokes written in black ink on giant white cards that were held just off camera by a very nice man called tony tony's job was holding up jokes for me to read out it didn't matter to him if the joke was good or bad clever or stupid he didn't care he passed no judgment he was like a good undertaker handling each case with professor anal detachment he didn't get involved i was expected to do the same sale the joke and move on deliver the monologue i tried but i was terrible at it as the early reviews for the show gleefully and wickedly pointed out i found myself seeing mean and bitchy things about people or groups of people who i didn't know anything about by doing the task assigned to me i found myself espousing the rage and questionable morality of wherever writer had been lucky enough to find favour with the producers that day i found i had to defend myself about jokes i had made on t v when i didn't agree or even have much knowledge of the stance i had supposedly taken i was just our bearing or does it became evident to me that if i was to continue on the show that if i were to espouse any rage and questionable moral judgment it would have to be my own otherwise i was inviting a level of self loathing that even an apostate scottish calvinist couldn't survive i fired the writers i disagreed with and hired a few who's velton xiong run in tandem with or complimented my own the monologue went from being a necessary chore to being a creative emotional outlet when it was at it's best it was more of an se that contained the requisite amount of jokes and op-ed call column in a suit and makeup know every night of course sometimes like most people i simply had nothing to say hence the annual latvian independence the monologue was born on some nights though maybe a dozen or so per year it all clicked and i made myself and a few others laugh or cry or think about things differently,1
B01MT8LC1F,the northern boundary of the roman empire ran right across what is now europe along the rivers rhine and danube plus in britain hadrian's wall marking a sharp north south contrast not just in political allegiance but in culture and the economy which outlasted the end of the western empire by sen injuries the roman world had many internal differences but on one level it was strikingly homogeneous held together by roads running between a network of cities with often remarkably similar public buildings largely in stone city nes cv liters with all the undertone tons of civility and civilization which the latin word still conveys to us defined the elite roman self image and education in classic latin literature greek literature in the greek speaking eastern empire and the ability to write elegantly formed part of aristocratic status quite as roman was extreme social inequality there were still many slaves in the roman world and the differences between rich and poor and the snobbery attached to those differences were acute all formed part of the complexity of the roman empire in every period now that the empire was christian which it had been come at least in terms of its governing elites in the fourth century christian religious literature was added to the mix and bishops began to rival senatorial aristocrats in influence but not much else changed in this respect few christian theologians for example notwithstanding the egalitarian imagery of the new testament ever thought slavery was wrong the contrast with what the romans called the barbarian world to the north was considerable there the economy was far simpler and so was local material culture political groupings were much smaller and simpler to and often indeed very fluid with identities changing as different ruling families rose rose and fell immediately north of the rhine and danube most of these groupings spoke germanic languages although none of them or the romans themselves saw this as marking any essential homogeneity between them i will use the words barbarian and germanic in what follows for convenience only not surprisingly barbarian peoples especially their leaders were very interested in the wealth of rome and tried to get some of it either by raiding even invasion or by taking paid service in the roman army there was a grey area along the frontier more militarized on the roman side more info minced by roman styles on the barbarian side as a result but broadly the boundary marked by the two great european rivers was a sharp one what happened in the fifth century in the western roman empire put succinctly is that barbarian incursions from the north although they had been a feature of most of imperial history this time led to political breakdown armies which did not call themselves roman took over the different western provinces and carved out kingdoms for themselves in four hundred none of this had started yet except in the balkans where gothic groups were trying to settle and trying to integrate into the roman army after fleeing into the empire from attacks by step nomads the people whom the romans called huns in the three hundred and seventies by five hundred the balkans in the eastern empire were under roman control again the west however was very different there a sector of the goths called by us the visigoths controlled gaul modern france south of the law and most of spain another sector the called by us the ostrogoths controlled italy and the alps burgundians control the rhone valley vandals controlled north africa modern tunisia and algeria a set of small scale frankish kings controlled most of northern goal and southeast britain a province actually abandoned by the romans already in the early fifth century was in the hands of tiny scale tribal communities called generically by us and perhaps by themselves angles and saxons there were others too in smaller areas territories of the former western empire which were not under the control of military elites originally from outside it's borders were very few and scattered mauritania roughly modern morocco parts of the central alps around kerr and western britain particularly wales plus brittany none of these had any link with the others still less with the roman empire in the east and they lost a row and identity fairly quickly too,0

B00NMUNUIO,maybe the companies don't have loyalty to their employees as well but clearly there is a different attitude towards the type of work that people want to do there's a clear increase in workforce mobility it is far easier now to get a job to leave accompany the barriers to entry and exit or down and it really has changed the whole economics and dynamics of the workforce there is a finite supply of talent and as far as i'm concerned if everybody does the same thing everybody can hire great people everybody does the same thing at best you're going to get average results ten years ago there was a big difference between passive and active candidates today that line is blurring it's very easy easy for a person who is really not looking for a job once he or she enters the job market looking for a job easy to find three or four other opportunities very very quickly add to that a post of new jobs being created very rapidly and it's difficult to train people to do technical jobs very quickly so the demand for jobs versus people be trained formed as a real lag with that another big point is that more and more companies are hiring their own recruiters and the more recruiters you have the more turnover you're going to have recruiters steal from other companies so back and forth you get this increase in turnover you add to that there is no longer a stigma for leaving accounts funny there's no longer a stigma for having three or four jobs in six years there's no longer a stigma for taking a counteroffer should have all of these things in some way a cultural shift of significant proportions underlying all of that technology has not kept pace a lot of new technologies available but it takes two three years for technology to start working and unfortunately the technology most people in recruiting and hr are using is really ten years old so even if it was current it would be two to three years old to add all of those dynamics together hiring is very very difficult to win in this kind of challenging environment the war for town is going on i truly believe there's a whole new hope i have rules that need to be implemented and what we want to talk about in this program is what do you really have to do to win the hiring game now let me ask you this have you ever done real good work as a recruiter had a couple of real good candidates and somehow your hiring managers messed it up has that ever happened anybody as a matter what you do no matter how good you are at your work if you're mad managers don't like the people present for one reason or other you've got to start over again so i go back to my history as a recruiter i knew it wasn't my fault that managers didn't like my candidates i knew my candidates were good weather is right or wrong didn't matter i believe they were good so a lot of the work that you see here and you see evolve was really my work as a recruit her trying to convince hiring managers to assess candidates properly and hire them properly and you'll see that come out here so it's been built up from trying to get hiring managers in control and that's why you'll see that a lot of this feels right for a hiring manager and feels right for recruiter but as i say from a recruiter's perspective and i'll say this again i look at the role recruiters two things number one to shift a hiring decision from a candidate away from short term stuff like compensation location and title to long term stuff like hey is this a good career opportunity on the hiring manager facing side it's the shift the hiring manager decision away from skills exp parents in qualifications to performance candy canada do the work that you need done and you'll see i don't compromise on performance although i try to get managers convinced that skills qualifications experience academics aren't as important as performance and you'll see that evolve here so imagine this if you can shift those two decisions you get candidates to think law term opportunity and performance and you get managers to think not skills and qualifications but performance were actually enabling us to do some real deep job matching and create career opportunities that's where we're going here so at least so you see it but i always ask this question and i'll say this i know ten years ago and i did record a tape with nightingale conant was called power hiring at the the time there was a cover story in fortune magazine ten years ago this month and on it it said the war for talent will finally be one with the internet job boards the emergence of this new tool called applicant tracking systems no longer will be difficult to hire top talent quickly and easily and efficiently it is now ten years later to the month probably almost to the day ten years after fortune magazine predicted the war for talent will be one how many of you feel it's now easier to hire top talent than ever before show of hands ts of sixty five industrious hard working good looking people nobody raised their hand how come is it harder or easier it's harder when you say it's probably harder in the last three years how come why is hiring still so challenging and so tough there's too many choices on the internet right candidates have more opportunities let me just say the internet i want to say has actually been better for,0

B002V0K2SC,life yet again manuel reached the building on the far side and ducked in behind the wall the stucco felt rough on his back even through his shirt he looked down and took another deep breath he'd forgotten to strap on his kevlar vest of all the times to screw up if he lived through this it would be a miracle a couple of cleansing breaths to slow his pulse and he moved to the narrow walkway behind the row of buildings a dirty street urchin in a ripped t-shirt watched him with disinterested eyes as he took a quick glance around the corner he could see the back of the house but the midday sun glinting off the second floor windows made it impossible to know whether any one was looking his way from behind the glass he checked his revolver again saw the bullets in the cylinder and felt a surge of confidence one more deep breath and he moved into harm's way crouching low and driving hard with his legs it didn't matter if escobar saw him walking or running now he knew the drug lord would be firing at im nothing manuel reached the stone wall between the target house and the walkway and hugged it for safety he was breathing hard now his adrenaline pumping through his veins like never before in his life so close so long to find him now so close how many men had died chasing false leads how many millions of dollars had been spent in the pursuit of this one man he had lost track but the fear figures were staggering he slipped his cell phone from his pocket and hit redial martinez answered how long until you get here manuel whispered to maybe three minutes no sirens come in quiet there is no sign he knows we're onto him roger that good work manuel had on we are almost there manuel closed the phone and powered it off an incoming call could alert escobar he stayed low against the wall the afternoon sun baking the narrow alley and turning it into a furnace sweat trickled down his forehead and he wiped it away with his free hand he was shaking almost uncontrollably he breathed deeply trying to calm himself and bring his heartbeat down so he could shoot accurately he checked his watch martinez was a minute maybe two out he decided to risk a quick look over the wall he raised his head above the rounded stucco edge nothing but silence greeted him the building was a two story adobe attached on both sides to the adjoining buildings the main floor was slightly larger than the upper and a sloping tiled roof ran under a large second floor window there was no balcony or veranda if escobar came out the back it would be through the window from his vantage point manuel knew he had a shot not a great one but he'd have to work with what he had then it happened manuel heard a series of loud thuds as martinez and his men used a battering ram on the heavy metal door at the front of the house no more stealth now he raised his head and shoulders above the wall and took aim on the window with his revolver seconds later the glass shattered and a chair flew into the yard a figure kicked out the remaining shards of glass then leaped from the window onto the tiled roof directly below manuel recognized him it was lemon overrode the haters escobar's personal bodyguard he resisted the urge to fire and waited for the next figure the man himself escobar appeared in the window for a brief second then jumped to the tiles below manuel waited until escobar landed then squeezed the trigger the smith and wesson barked and sharp pieces of stucco flew about only an inch or two from escobar's head he fired again but escobar was already moving and the bullets smacked harmlessly into the pale stucco behind him ma manuel briefly caught a glimpse of lehman sighting on him then the wall in front of his face exploded and slivers of stucco slammed into his forehead and scalp the pain was excruciating blood poured from the wounds but he jumped up and lowered his gun at the running figures he pumped round after round at them but they were moving too quickly and the shoe shots missed the hammer clicked on an empty chamber he swore as he reached for his belt and another cylinder of live cartridges then when it looked like the two men might escape limone jerked violently and fell face first to the ground unmoving a few seconds later escobar took three slugs in quick succession the first one shattered his femur the second cut through his chest cavity and the third smashed squarely into his skull he dropped straight down his body falling hard on a pile of cinder blocks and tiles blood pooled under the body and small rivulets ran off the broken pieces onto the parched earth manuel glanced quickly around,0
B01FL199UO,like every day he began innocently with the flag salute followed by the principles daily announcement a mind numbing blend of information he thought was important for us to know it became quickly apparent that today's announcement took on a far different tone than usual the principal went off script to issue a warning about a man dressed in a clown costume loitering near the school according to police this clown had been spotted on several occasions attempting to lure children into his vehicle news of this clown touched off widespread anxiety it wasn't long before the clown was the topic of every conversation all around the playground children began to speculate about who would be his next victim hushed whispers breathe life into a rumor that this clown was a killer the realization that one of us could be plucked off the street never to be seen again dampened our nervous excitement as the seriousness of the situation cast a pall across campus after the announcement i spent the rest of the day moving about the campus listening to the nervous chatter of my classmates their fearful comments made me wonder how things got out of control so quickly no one ever said this clown was a killer in my mind he was nothing more than a harmless old man but funny or not he was still out there and until he was caught this particular clown posed a danger to all of us to prove my feeling that this was just a silly clown i decided to walk home alone things started out pretty well with a clear patch ahead and no sign of the clown i was feeling good about my chances that was until i heard the sound of a slow moving vehicle approaching me from behind and uncomfortable feeling settled in as the engine noise grew louder causing the ground to rumble beneath me as the vehicle slowed to match my gate my confidence began to crumble as i realized the vehicle and it's occupant were stalking me it should have been obvious but i had no clue about who would be following me i stole a glance over my shoulder and was startled to see a dark colored forward a connell line van with a cheap set of white wall tires keeping pace with each of my steps the driver was a creepy looking older man i struggled momentarily to figure out who he was and what made him look so weird was it the face painted shiny white with bright colors circling his bloodshot eyes and darkened mouth where was it his red bulbous nose littered with broken spider veins crawling across the bridge and blending into his ruddy cheeks whoever he was his grotesque appearance made me shudder i couldn't figure out why a clown would want to look so scary then it hit me it was the clown,1
B00HHF5N7G,hugging the eastern slope of san francisco's famous knob hill is one of the unique spots of this continent a small compact area overlooking the busy harbour at it's feet it extends only a few blocks in either direction above it's narrow congested streets the chimes of beautiful grace cathedral ring through the quarter hours and tourists and curio seekers in a bear three minutes can stroll from the city's fashionable shopping district into the heart of old china chinatown in san francisco teams with haunting memories for it is wrapped in the atmosphere customs and manners of a land across the sea the same pacific ocean leaves the shores of both worlds a tangible link between old and new past and present orient and occident to this china in the west there came in the opening decade of this century a young chinese with his wife and family there they settled among the other cantonese and as the years slipped by the couple established their place in the community i tell the story of their fifth daughter jade snow born to them in san francisco until she was five years old jade snow's world was almost wholly chinese for her world was her family the wong's life was secure but formal sober but quietly happy and the few problems she had were entirely concerned with what was proper or improper in the behavior of a little chinese girl oil even at this early age she had learned the meaning of discipline without understanding the necessity for it a little girl never questioned the commands of mother and father unless prepared to receive painful consequences she never addressed an older person by name it was always older brother oldest sister second older sister third older sister she had died at one month without a name but still she held a place in the family and forth older sister only her mother and father or their generation of uncles and aunts address them as blessing from heaven jade swallow jade lotus or jade ornament in short a little girl was never casual with her elders even in handing them something she must use both hands to signify that she paid them undivided attention respect and order these were the keywords of life it did not matter what were the thoughts of a little girl she did not voice them she assumed that her mother must love her because mother made her bright silk chinese dresses for holiday were embroidered with gold threads and bright colored beads and washed her her and cleaned her white buckled sandals father must love her because he taught her her first lessons from chinese books and put her high on his shoulders above the crowds so that she could watch from unobstructed heights the lion dances on the streets at chinese new years and sometimes he took her downtown with him on business errands to that outside foreign american world but in spite of her parents love she must always be careful to do the proper thing failure to do so brought immediate and drastic punishment teaching and whipping were almost synonymous once because in fun she had knocked older brothers hat off his head when she passed him on the stairs father whipped her with a bundle of tied kane then and he withdrew permission for her to go with older sister to visit the city zoo since she had never been to the zoo and had looked forward to this treat for a week the disappointment and the shame heard almost worse than the whipping another time when their neighbor's son spit on her as she was playing she ran to tell mother who was sewing overalls in the factory which was also their home mother did not sympathize but reproved her saying that she must have spit on her playmat first or he wouldn't have spit on her she was told to bring a clothes hanger and in front of all the other working women mother spanked her again the shame was almost worse than the pain and the pain was bad enough for a mother usually spanked until the wooden hanger broke thus life was a constant puzzle no one ever troubled to explain only through punishment did she learn that what was proper was right and what was improper was wrong,1

B071LF21SS,the desolation was oppressive the insects made no sound and had she not seen them moving up close she would have assumed that they were some trick her mind was playing on her samantha his heart stopped as another large shadow flashed to the right of her again she turned rapidly and found only an empty shell of an egg freeway staring back at her her stomach nearly rolled over as heavy breathing caressed her left ear and her feet cemented themselves to the ground my eye he was for a dual or didn't come brie at ease something was being dragged through the sand and the new arrival of sound filled her body with dread a gnarled tip of something caressed the back of her neck and it propelled her to react she threw up both hands and sprinted several feet forward in a fear induced panic and her screams filled her ears she turned around and saw a deformed body it stood months steadily upon two greyish legs that seemed to ripple as though something was moving just under the first layer of flesh use dome remembers his me is you evens after i gives you so much as one of the security guards looked into room twenty six fourteen while checking on one of the tormented patients his hands instantly went to the baton that hung on his utility belt his eyes adjusted to the pale light coming from inside the room and he stared in disbelieving horror the woman ins sign the room appeared to be bleeding from hundreds of cuts on her body he quickly reached into his pockets and pulled out his rubber gloves the woman's screams escalated and his vision was ripped away from his hands to her tortured face he accomplished the task of putting the gloves on while his eyes and mind stared uncomprehending lie at the scene unfolding within the room the guard watched as the woman ripped off her gown and exposed her body to him blood streamed from hundreds of deep lacerations on her torso and legs he looked at her hands but saw no instrument that would have allowed her to mutilate her flesh and such fashion as his fingers closed around the handle of the door her body arched backward causing her to strike her head on the floor as her feet remained fixed her screams rang in his ears and he struggled with the door handle as she bent backward again striking her head and spraying blood all over the walls of the room after the first turn he could simply follow the shouting and mass of humanity that was converging towards the end of the hall he saw staff members who had been in the room pushed their way through the waves of bodies that were standing by to render aid lattes and ten dollar bagels spilled all over the white and black speckled fly floor a wave of deja vu came over james and the image of the tactical team throwing up all over the front lawn pushed to the forefront of his thoughts james pulled out his badge and began to pull people out of the way some moved easily while others he had to literally pick up and toss there were shouts of aggravation but he paid them little note as he neared the door whatever had happened was over now and it seemed that the chaos now stemmed from the staff who were trying to determine what to do shouts of you stupid bastard he was a cop don't you think they will want some answers and who in the hell was supposed to be guarding him for safety he nearly he killed someone on the way here spurred him on the world swayed under him as he pushed through the door and took in the cause of the panic he momentarily lost his footing and nearly fell the scent of rotting meat mixed with fresh blood filled the room a strong pair of hands caught him and stood him upright no sir you can't be here this area is off limits it's thought to contain a possible contagion,0
B0044G0ZGA,how awoke to find himself stumbling over level ground which seemed to heave and below under his feet like the ocean surface from the position of procyon overhead it was mid-morning he was no longer in the circle amanda held him by one arm supporting and guiding him old man held and supported him i'm on the other side with equal strength as how turned his head to see the other old man looked up smiled fleetingly but warmly and then looked ahead again to the dormitory building containing a maid's office to which the two were taking how what is it said how what's wrong to his own surprise his voice came out like a whisper his throat was raw from repeating the words that still throbbed in his mind he walked for twenty three hours house at amanda i think you'd have killed yourself the way a horse can run itself to death if we hadn't pulled you out of the circle now lean on us we'll have you in bed in a minute suddenly he fell a longing to be where she had promised horizontal on a flat surface and the darkness of a quiet closed room consciousness of the exhaustion of his body flooded in on him his knees gave at every step and his legs wobbled with weakness he staggered on between old man and amanda to the dormitory building and the outs side entrance that led directly to the office to the bed and onto it thank you said amanda to old man he smiled back at her then went softly and swiftly out she took a blanket from the bed and hung it over the windows on a rod above them that had not been there when how had last seen them the blanket did not completely shut out person's intense light but it dimmed the room and how luxuriating in the dimness amanda went around to the other side of the bed and lay down on top of the bedcovers beside him she put her arms around him now sleep she commanded he closed his eyes and sleep eep swooped down to carry him away when he woke the room was totally dark amanda slumbered beside him now tucked in under the covers in ordinary fashion she opened her eyes as he stirred he laid his hand on her shoulder lightly you sleep he whispered i'll be back in awhile he got up found his clothes amanda or someone had obviously undressed him while he was still too deep in sleep to notice and let himself into the outer air on the other side of the office door beyond the walls and the blanket that served as a curtain over the window he found the first faint light don he guessed it at about four in the morning he must have slept for nearly as long as amanda had said he had walked his body worked better now than it had on its way to bed from the circle but it still held a feeling of having been used and overused he was not so much weak as drained of strength a few light we're on and the two dormitory buildings particularly in the part of each one which held kitchen and dining facilities the mountains to the east were a distant darkness beyond the lip of the ledge and the few figures moved about the area with the intentions of those on duty of one kind or another but in the near distance were two lights still could be seen burrow earning paled by the approaching days illumination the circle still turned those in it still chanted and four people stood in a small group waiting their turn he walked away from the building toward the circle and those who waited but he stopped back a little from joining the waiters and stood merely watching them and those in the circle for a few moments then he turned and went on parallel with the stream beyond them toward the edge of the ledge at the point where the stream emptied into the pond he found a level space of ground beside it and sat down looking across it toward the end of the ledge only some five meters beyond and at the black ridge of the grandfathers of dawn distant their upper edges now a jagged glowing line from the ascending sun hidden behind them so slowly as he sat watching that glowing line he found himself beginning to understand how tom's dying with his guilt still unexpected in him could stop howl from ever finding the creative universe amanda had been right the way he searched for was to be found out here among people youll rather than back there in that artificial if valued and special atmosphere of the encyclopedia,0
B0744XP4L1,in fact he went on to win the silver slugger award which is given to the top hitter in each field position and he made the all-star team more importantly his team began to see him as a leader and he has kept that important role every season since we had our initial phone call in another case i worked with a player who was a classic reluctant leader in fact he was committed to not taking on a leadership role despite this player's reservations his character work ethic and talent ensured that he became the leader and he will always hold a prominent place in his team's history the bottom line is that leaders come in many forms we often talk about natural leaders people born with the talent and personality traits to blossom when given a positive environment the fact of the matter is great leaders are not born they are made whether it happens on a ball field or in a conference room this book provides common sense solutions to issues often perceived as major problems in the corporate environment too often we muddy the water by combining coaching and training neglecting the difference between these two activities training is teaching work skills it usually focuses on processes procedures tools and technology coaching is harnessing those skills to best fit the work environment coaches create an environment in which leaders can lead it's about putting skills in context the key to cultivating a strong leadership at every level of your organization in short leadership is learned that emerges through trial and error which is made easier when you adhere to common sense approaches to the work process this book guides potential leaders through the process of self evaluation to determine if they have the tools to succeed if you decide to become a leader then you are supported through a process to develop the necessary skills remember it takes more than a title to make a leader true leaders are defined by their performance and by how they touch people's lives every day chapter one let common sense be your guide to leading i was invited to speak at an international life coaching convention a few years ago and asked the person who had contacted me by phone what do you do she said we certify corporate coaches and life coaches i was curious so i asked her what do you personally do she said i'm a certified life and corporate coach her voice and enthusiasm had given me the impression that she was quite young so i asked her how old she was i'm twenty one she said that fact alone gave me some reservations about this young woman's organization after all experience both in the workplace and life in general is crucial to coaching before declining i decided to get a second opinion i called a friend of mine who was a corporate executive and i asked what are some criteria you use to hire life coaches and corporate coaches he laughed and he said their hair has to be greater than mine that made the decision for me there are so many organizations that make money off coaching certification programs without setting clear standards for the people they claim to serve they plant an idea in the minds of these young people leading them to believe they can be successful when they're not really qualified to coach that's not to say that some day they won't have enough experience under their belts to be effective coaches but certifying recent college grads who have spent limited time in any professional situation sends the wrong message about what coaching entails i think leadership falls into that same category there are obviously many types of leadership the inherited leadership especially in family owned businesses corporate leadership where board members talk about who is next in line to be ceo or chairman and there are top performers as especially in sales where it's easy to set up a leaderboard and,0
B01M2CC4WL,ninety three he'd figured out hotter than that and it was a spectacularly unpleasant noisemaker the late summer heat was supposed to have broken today no such luck the unplug the box fan from the outlet by his bed and carried it back across his tiny unit chicago windows were hello weird strangely wide and tall and they almost always came in pairs with a six inch wide column in between the two windows in the all-wood frame im thank god because he needed that second window all the time to vent the stuffy of unlike air after a day of being shut up he'd kill for some cross ventilation but this wasn't college he couldn't just opened his door to the hall and try to create a draft out the windows that overlooked the alley turned out people neighbors most of whom still didn't look him in the eye in the hall thought that was weird well not weird exactly more like a sign there'd been either a break-in burglary or worse inside he would have sworn the older lady from next door who'd turtle their head in from the hall the week he'd moved in with sir surprise to find him alive and happy and watching porn on his ipad okay the porn probably wasn't a surprise to anyone except in the holy shit way he jackknifed up off the bed he'd sort of forgotten the door was open not like it out of hand down his shorts for crying out loud although he might may maybe possibly have had a palm draped suggestively across his crotch and since it was so fuckin hot he hadn't been wearing anything except those silky basketball shorts nothing on top nothing underneath and yes maybe his dick had been a tiny bit noticeable pressing out against the slippery fabric but she was old right she probably seen it all a thousand times before he'd told himself that night after hearing the gasp from the door jumping up and then watching a white haired grandma vanish out of sight as if she'd been taken down by a cheetah sure was hot enough to pass for the serengeti so no cross ventilation but a box fan blowing out an open window still helped suck the hot air out so he set it up before stripping down to his underwear which was sweaty crows cold shower time and wasn't that just extra depressing he remembered when cold showers met been so horny over a girl he was worn out jacking off to fantasies over and he opted for the second best way to calm his dick down this summer he'd been too fucking hot to get horny much although he had seriously ended up going home with more than one girl from a bar when she mentioned that she had central air an embarrassing reason to f fuck someone but sex was sex i e almost always better than not having sex and the lure of not sweating through his sheets again was hella strong cashed in believe in wasting gilt on shit that simple if god or buddha or the universe or whoever didn't want to go home with girls for a cool place to sleep then he shouldn't have let cash is cheap ass landlord lie in the listing about the unit having air conditioning fair's fair but seriously there was nothing like drenching himself in some nice cold water rinsing the fantastic accumulation of an outdoor day's worth of sweat from his ass and soaping the hell out of his balls because holy chafing batman it was too hot to run unless he wanted to go at five am before the sun came up and that idea alone was worth a chuckle and an ideal but biking was still decent less effort better breeze the chafing was killing him though he always thought the guys at the bike shop were bull shitting when they'd sold in the expensive seat for the calabro but whichever ass moron had designed the junker he rode now had death definitely not known how to keep a bike seat from rubbing the skin off his inner thighs ouch he patted himself dry gently walked out of the tiny bathroom and flopped onto his unmade bed he was cool he was clean it was glorious food was required though it was too hot to cook anything eating frozen peas out of the bag sounded all right or maybe a smoothie he tried to remember the last time eating a hot meal at night and couldn't think of anything except the happy hour burger he'd had at mickey schmucks right at the beginning of the heatwave five bucks from a cormac and she mixed berger score less than two minutes later he started sweating again not score he thought about running a shower on cold and hanging out in the bathroom for awhile having learned from experience you could cool down the small space pretty impressively with the shower curtain open but the guilt was a killer back in college steph had always been up his ass recycling and reducing as humans,0
B01MDU4PQN,if i'd known my morning was going to split into two possibilities i would have bought two cinnamon rolls one for me and one for the other me what time did you get into town last night my cousin ryan martin asked me about one am thanks for leaving the door unlocked and thanks for letting me stay with you guys we stood on the corner across from campus waiting for the light to change we were on our way to work and had just stopped at boulder bruce for coffee and cinnamon rolls ryan was the chief of the university police and i was the new physics professor i'll be out of your hair as soon as i can shifting my book bag on my shoulder i took a big bite of my roll it was still warm with gooey cream cheese icing mmmm my other hand was starting to cramp as it held the almost too hot paper cup of coffee no hurry madison he said but if you're still staying with us when the baby's born you'll have to help out my my pleasure i squinted up at him the sun was as blinding as a laser colorado definitely seemed sunnier than missouri i wished i'd worn sunglasses i wished i owned sunglasses i volunteer to help no matter where i'm living who wouldn't want to help with an adorable little baby b thanks he smiled at me from his six foot plus height so are you excited about your new job as i stood there it was taking all my self control not to break into a happy dance right there on the sidewalk does a supernova spew heavy elements he raised his eyebrows at me i grinned and that's a yes i'm excited i've been working towards this for the last decade it's a dream come true what did ted say about it ryan asked staring at me did you guys break up my boyfriend ted was still back in st louis debating what to say i took a sip of coffee we didn't break up but it wasn't pretty tell me what happened he said you owe me i confided in you when i was getting ready to propose to sydney and look how good that turned out five years of bliss true i pointed at him with my coffee cup and now a little one on the way how many more days until she's due nice try but you don't get to change the subject that easily what happened with ted at first he seemed supportive i said he said congratulations and everything and then he prompted he asked me if i took the job as if there was some question about it my voice started rising obviously i took it anybody would take it which is what i told him then he got all whiny asking what it meant for him and me he actually brought up that we had talked about talking about getting married some coffee slapped out of my cup as i gestured with it talked about talking he laughed so he didn't ask you to marry him or even talk about getting married i never liked that guy i know the crowd waiting to cross the street was getting quite large there must have been twenty or thirty people on the sidewalk geez this is a long light do change the subject he said i knew ted was just upset because he loves me and he thought i was leaving him but i started getting a little torqued so so let me guess you blow up at him ryan asked yeah there was some yelling then i grinned but later we made up and let me tell you the makeup zeke's was great he frowned too much information i laughed you're such a guy ryan i took another sip of coffee and thought about ted it was wonderful being with a guy like ted who actually understood what i did for a living mentioning elementary particles like corks and neutrinos to most folks made there our eyes glaze over i was still thinking about him when the walk sign finally lit up and i absent mindedly stepped off the curb into the crosswalk something slammed into me my coffee and cinnamon roll flew out of my hands and mo and my bookbag thumped against my back before taking it's own trajectory my left leg and hip crumpled as i hit the pavement with a splat as my fingertips dug into the gravel and asphalt i struggled to lift my head up off the ground what was going on and why didn't it hurt,0
B00D8LU66Q,the emancipation proclamation was carefully limited to the areas that were in rebellion against the united states in other words to the very places where lincoln had no authority to enforce the emancipation proclamation and so knowing that we find ourselves asking what then was the purpose of that proclamation for another example many of us believe that lincoln and douglas engaged in their famous series of debates while both men were running for president in eighteen sixty it's true they ran against each other for president in eighteen sixty but that's not when the debates took place the debates took place two years earlier in the context of a senate campaign in illinois and they were particularly formative in lincoln's later life and thought some of us have learned that lincoln wrote the gettysburg address on the back of an envelope while he was riding on the train up to deliver the speech this is an item of folklore for which so far as i know there is no factual evidence to support it we think about the house divided speech that lincoln gave in eighteen fifty eight as remarkably prophetic because it forecasts the civil war but in fact it did no such thing indeed it explicitly said that lincoln did not expect the union to be divided or the house to fall what then are we to make of the house divided speech while these are four examples of ideas that we will explore in more depth as we look at lincoln in his own words but just as there are things that we've come to know about lincoln and the popularly believe that aren't so there are some of the aspects of lincoln's past that we have conveniently forgotten i say conveniently because it gives us a clearer and less ambiguous picture of lincoln but also a much less realistic picture of lincoln for example lincoln as a lawyer defended clients who were seeking to reclaim fugitive slaves he defended clients on both sides of that issue lincoln publicly stated in one of his debates with douglas and thereafter that he could not imagine that the black race and the white race you could coexist in this country under conditions of perfect equality and that as long as that was so he as well as anybody was in favor of having the superior position assigned to the white race that he did not believe black should serve on juries until the last years of his life he did not believe that any black should vote and he did not believe that blacks and whites should be permitted to intermarry now these are views of lincoln's on the matter of race relations that may seem somewhat embarrassing to us in a contemporary context in fact they were rather enlightened for the context of lincoln's time and as we explore lincoln in his own words we will try to put those views into the context of his time lincoln believed throughout his entire political career that the best solution to the problem of race relations was what henry clay had called colonization that is freeing the slaves but immediately moving them back to an africa to establish colonies there and that also reflected his belief that blacks and whites simply could not coexist in the united states on peaceful tarps lincoln was opposed to slavery that's true and yet lincoln was willing even after he became president to support a constitutional amendment that would in perpetuity have guaranteed slavery in the southern states where it then existed he was willing to support such an amendment because he bill believe that slavery was protected by the constitution anyway that he had no power to do anything about it and so such an amendment would only put into words what everybody already understood that of course is a very different picture from the popular image of lincoln as a committed abolitionist in fact for that matter the political program of abolition was one which lincoln never supported throughout his career even though he was firmly opposed on grounds of principle and morality to slavery when i let's think for a moment about these examples,1
B009ZN5AVM,somewhere over the edge of the world the sun had long since risen out of sa bagua the great sea but along the margins of wabanaki nothing was visible in the thick fog except the ghostly silhouettes of narrow spruces along the shore of the low island and the pain ale band of gray barnacle encrusted rock where the falling tide surged and sucked too long high proud bark wigwam all moved along the islands lie three men and each digging their slender paddles deep to move the sly leak canoes forward as they rounded the island the sun suffused the fog with a pale golden light but the paddlers had no time to admire the change for now though rollers were coming in from the open ocean the men had to time their strokes to the lifting swells keeping the canoes angle ld into the waves so they would not broach nevertheless the lively sees sometimes broke shockingly cold over the bows these boats were not the big sea going was scowl aqua giant dugouts carved from the trunks of great pines canoes built to carry fifteen people though nearly twenty feet long these bark canoes were small craft and big waters and while the men were skilled they knew disaster les just a careless moment or unexpected wave away but a loon cold distant in the fog and another answered it unseen long unearthly wails quavering over the water and the men smiled at one another the mother were les were the messengers of clues gabon the one who made himself and perhaps they were asking him to watch over their canoes on this auspicious and for lightening day for a long time they moved in a world of missed their own breath white with the morning chill seeing nothing beyond the bows of their boats in the stern of the first canoe sat a sat gamer leader named contaminate though we building a long steering paddle he navigated carefully but not blindly keeping his bearings by the direction of the swells and by listening for the crash of waves on the receding shore behind them the fog made the men in the canoes feel as though they remained motionless no matter how hard they paddled but katana netto never wavered never appeared to be lost to one of the men barely out of his teens this ability seemed almost supernatural katana does name after all meant doer of great magic but it was simply the product of a lifetime spent along the wabanaki coast knowing how the currents flowed among these islands on a rising tide and taking into account the freshening breeze that now twisted the fog into raves cotton or netto set the course then with stunning speed the mist began to split and lift stripped away by the rising wind and brilliant sun what was moments before a world cloistered in gray took on the bright edges and sharp shadows of morning all around them lay the complexity of a rock him the shores spruce islands long peninsulas and deep bays that formed the beautiful edge of wabanaki extending before katrina neto and his companions still hazy in the dissipating fog was a series of stepping stone islands humped with low hills and black with forest they paddled for an hour passing rocky ledges on which dozens of us ascii gra were hauled out their smooth mottled pelts shining in the sun the smaller seals had faces like dogs but the much larger grey ones had long muzzles like those of the big antlered mas of the forest in autumn when they ask iguana were fat they provided meat and oil and even now at the beginning of summer they were good eating but the men who had no harpoons and had other things on their minds this morning didn't stir when a gray ascii gua surfaced near their canoes the strengthening sun warmed cotton and at those face glinting off the light bone ornaments in his long black hair,0
B077K21Z89,my feet lead me to the stairs automatically while erupt a woolen scarf around my neck several times so i was ready to depart once more into the frosty winter air mycroft watson exclaimed and drew my attention back to the present only then did i realize that i had completely forgotten the doctrine my pursuit would you please explain what's going on you know very well it surely wouldn't ask for help if not press for a bike extraordinary circumstances the fat he didn't even have time to personally to himself speaks for itself i had already departed the room made for the entrance door of the building so watson had no option but to follow me that's not what i was talking about the sun is of no consequence i said with emphasis whatever has happened was strange but didn't change a thing about the obvious course of action the post of his stamp is already six days old there is no time to lose anita depart for milan immediately milan he has docked wasn't going to italy i said and opened the door to the building with force so it swung wide open much to mrs hudson's and the winds who had exited her room to investigate the commotion freezing air rushed in bringing with it snowflakes which melted on contact with a warm heavy floor farewell watson quickly stepped in front of me and blocked my path was crossed arms and legs wide apart i will not sit idly by while you rush off to the continent in fact i insist on accompanying you for a moment i blinked confusedly in the face of the doctor's persistence even though my brother held him in high regard and had subsequently taken to bringing him along any case he could possibly manage i had my reservations tours easy to move alone improvisation has always been my most prized skill impossible to employ when you have a short slow at untrained men glued to your side but even though i could have easily brought forth any number of convenient arguments i couldn't use him if something should happen is showed while at force watson to stay behind would have had a hard time reconciling with him the secret keeper could quickly become a great liability i sighed internally and curse myself alone as circumstances evolve like that to sort of lazy convenience no there was no choice in the matter how could i have even thought of leaving the faithful watson behind i will be back in half now and expect you to be travel ready by then was nodded and gave wave for me to exit the building a casita fear uncertainty in his face but also resolve and gratitude and that was enough for now i pray that i wasn't going to regret the decision perhaps a cowboy stood outside the driver wrapped in a thick blanket the horse breathing steams of clouds into the winter air i didn't turn around as i climbed in the cabin gave the order to take me back to the diogenes there was no time to pick up anything from a private residence and had some things to arrange which would require the facilities of the club the dodge and his club was my home away from home housing not only the secret service city headquarters but also of his space i almost never left while i conducting a bit of the queen and country and yes i did indeed possess a much used armchair that much of watson's account was true even if his stories of greek interpreters have been the product of his boundless imagination,0

B00HEMF4CQ,talking so we just sat there and watched two hours of carnage and maiming wasn't the cleverest thing for me to have let julie look at she burst into tears she was always alright if she wasn't aware of the dramas she knew very little of what i did and i never asked questions because she told me she didn't want the answers oh you're off when are you coming back was the most she would ever ask but this time it was different for once she knew where i was going as she drove me through the darkness towards camp i said why don't you get yourself that dog he were on about it will be company for you i'd meant well but it set off the tears again i got her to drop me off a little way from the main gates i walked from a i said with a strained smile on a the exercise see you when i see you she said as she packed me on the cheek neither of us went a bundle on long goodbyes the first thing that hits you when you enter squadron lines the camp accommodation area is the noise vehicles revving men hollering for the return of bits of kit and from every bedroom any unmarried causes a different kind of music on maximum what this time it was also much louder because so many of us were being sent out together i met up with dinner mark the keyway and stan the other three members of my gang a few of the unfortunates who weren't going to the gulf still came in anyway and joined in a slagging and blackening we loaded our kits into cars and drove up to the top end of the camp where transports were waiting to take us to brize norton as usual i took my sleeping bag onto the aircraft with me together with my walkman washing and shaving kit and broke it i took two hundred benson and hedges if we found ourselves dumped in the middle of nowhere or hanging around a deserted airfield for days on end it wouldn't be the first time we flew out by rf v c ten my passively smoked the twenty or so cigarettes that dang i got through in the course of the seven hour flight honking at him all the while as usual my complaints had no effect whatsoever it was excellent company however despite his filthy habit originally with para rage dinger was a veteran of the falklands they looked the part as well rough and tough with a voice that was scary and eyes that were scarier still but behind the football hooligan face lay a sharp analytical brain thing i could polish off the daily telegraph crossword in no time much to my annoyance out of uniform it was also an excellent cricket and rugby player and an absolutely lousy dancer dinner danced the way virgil tracy walked when it came to the crunch though he was solid and unflappable we landed at riyadh to find the weather typically pleasant for the time of year in the middle east but there was no time to soak up the rays cover transports were waiting on the tarmac and we were whisked away to a camp in isolation from other coalition troops the advance party had got things squared away sufficiently to answer the first three questions you always ask when you arrive at a new location where do i sleep where do i ate and where is the bulk home for our half squadron we discovered with a hanger about one hundred meters long and fifty meters wide into it were crammed forty blokes and all manner of stores and equipment including vehicles weapons and ammunition there were piles of gear everywhere everything from insect repellent and ration the laser target markers and boxes of high explosive it was a matter of just getting in amongst it and trying to make your own little world as best as you could mine was made out of several large crates containing outboard engines arranged to give me a sectioned off space that i covered with a tarpaulin to shelter me from the powerful arc lights overhead there were many separate hives of activity each with it's own noise radios tuned into the bbc world service walkmans with plug in speakers that thundered out folk rap and heavy metal there was a strong smell of diesel petrol and exhaust fumes because we're driving in and outs all the time as blokes went off to explore other parts of the camp and see what they could pinch and of course while they were away their kit in turn was being explored by other blogs,0
B008CP6MFM,parents loom large in their children's lives they take on mythical proportions even as their offspring age a father's hands may always be remembered as strong even after they've withered from arthritis a mother's words have the power to endure even after death in the memories of her children their laughs and their smiles may haunt as much as warm their children into middle age and beyond if in the end tom and carol lucas devoted themselves to the memories of linda and their unborn granddaughter theirs wasn't a family of norman rockwell images and currier and ives christmases i don't know why we're not closer carroll would say the kids just don't come around our door is always open tom pondered glumly but we don't see them much although it was where their story would take them the family's beginnings weren't in texas thomas eaton lucas was born in dunbar west virginia and his horse crusty voice even in the waning years of middle age would still betray those influences he met carol maxine morrison a p plain spoken midwesterner in her hometown of port huron michigan when tom was an assistant manager at a dime store two doors from the dress shop where she worked as the credit manager there were lots of tents and stores in those days tom remembers we had a counter where folks came in for lunch carol's boss the dress store manager introduced them and before long tom noticed carol lingering outside the store sometimes she'd watch me decorate the windows says tom a big tall dark haired man with heavy jowls and a booming voice i guess it was about a year after we met that we started dating i like to look at him admits carol a soft spoken round woman with deep set eyes and thick curly blonde hair sometimes i'd smile and he'd smile back at me at the time tom's parents lived in cambridge ohio when tom moved to be closer to them he convinced carroll to follow they married on july twenty second nineteen sixty two and traveled through ohio settling in martins ferry where tom worked in a steel mill children arrived in a pack first brian followed by barry and then brent cara was pregnant a fourth time in five years when they learned some startling news about their second son barry the four year old followed a ball into the street and never heard the school bus screeched to a stop it almost hit him barry hadn't talked much but we didn't think much of it bryan talked for him carroll says we'd asked the doctor but he said not to worry when we had barry tested we found out he was deaf not much later on december thirtieth nineteen sixty eight a cold winter day cara went into labor tom loaded her in the family's volkswagen and bumped along the country roads to get to the hospital we were expecting another big old baby boy tom says with a shrug after three sons we'd given up on the idea of a daughter they rushed into the emergency room and carroll was ushered in quickly while tom filled out the paperwork ten minutes later before carol had time to get out of her dress and into a hospital gown their first baby girl was born at eight pounds and one ounce through all three boys carroll had the name brenda picked out just in case they had a daughter now she held brenda theresa lucas in her arms carroll didn't pay a lot of attention to the fact that the doctor continued to push on her abdomen and that the nurses hadn't left the room one in the days before routine ultrasounds carol didn't know another surprise was in the offing she'd never been told she carried twins but eight minutes later a second perfect pink daughter entered the world a bit smaller than her older sister at six pounds one ounce both infants were healthy here's your number to the doctor said holding up the baby i was shocked carroll said absolutely shocked when the doctor came out to talk to the nervous father he asked tom what was it you wanted well carroll wanted a girl but if it's a boy it's okay with me he answered while your wife got her wish the doctor said and before tom could get excited the physician added and she got two of them i got weak in the knees and thought i was going down tom says with a laugh i threw my wide-brimmed hat in the air and i whooped and hollered carroll had named the other four children and when she held her final child in her arms the proud mother came up with yet another bee name this one belinda tracy lucas from the moment his parents brought his twin sisters home brian who was five at the time would remember being enthralled with them he held them especially belinda the smallest helping to soothe the girls when they cried he couldn't say belinda and struggled with tracy ending up calling the youngest sibling katie do do we when she got older belinda would reference her position as the last born the lucas family line up and nickname herself number five with so many youngsters to care for carol became a stay at home mom she could have worked but we put the emphasis on taking care of the kids tom says that meant we didn't have as much money as some families,1

B0799Q2CZK,the tiny magnification can reveal i let most of the sand fall through my fingers and zoom in again on the specs left stuck to my skin they resolve into the calcified shells of organisms that once lived in the sea chips of coral and peach coloured fragment of shell minuscule lumps of all levine have been tumbled smooth by the violence of the ocean along with a few specks of quartz even as i studied the microscopic world in my palm i knew i should have gone over to mir and charlie but i tried recording them close up during the picnic and i kept wanting to cry i don't want to spoil today i've done that too many times did i did that too many times i didn't want to spoil that day on the beach it was supposed to be perfect but it is not enough i brushed the last grains of sand from my hands just like all the other times and looked down the coastline i cannot help but identify the different strata of rock exposed in the cliffs it's impossible to ignore the booming sound of the sea in a nearby cave that's been carved out by so many thousand years of rule bluntness energy from the waves farther down the coastline i see a stack of rock left standing in the sea now looking like it was never once part of the cliff shading my eyes i stare at it imagining the way the sea beat against it's former connection to the headland how it bludgeoned the softer rock and made it crumble i picture a rugged hole between it and the rest of the cliff a gaping wound where the sea has smashed space between the stack and it's saw source a thin bridge of rock all that's left joining it to the land than i imagined that last connection collapsing the roar of the rock plummeting into the sea the stack left stranded out on it's own anna charlie calls come and have a drink i look at him and mir for the stretch of sand between us and feel as if my legs are rooted in place i simply cannot cross the distance between us i'm fine thanks i call and turned back to the ocean like all massifs even full sensory memory recordings get stale i have echoes of the feelings that flooded me when i recorded this day triggered by the associated neural pathways being lit up by my chips playback but weaker than when i first came back and sank into this recording those pathways have been distorted by all the other emotions experienced in the months since not just diluted but fundamentally changed like those chips of olivine the playback of this day on the beach has been tumbled by the wash of my thoughts and emotions it's sharp edges smoothed it's original raw shape soften and now there is a new emotion being added to the churn one i am trying my best to ignore i am afraid as soon as i acknowledge the fear i try to suppress it in some bizarre way i am surprised nothing is altering the force of the sunlight here if this were a dream a thunderhead would be blooming in the sky behind me it's shadow which stretch across the sand swallowing my own whipping the gentle breeze into schooley gusts and adding white crests to the waves meyer and charlie would look up at the gathering storm she would probably start to cry and he would hurriedly pack away the picnic as the sand stings his legs we would all know something terrible is coming something destructive if that will end this fragile warmth and shift this haven of natural beauty into something that wants to scrub us from it's presence with waves and rain but the sky remains blue and the cloud is nothing but an echo in my imagination reverberating through mental corridors to where i am now a long way away from its cause yes i am on this speech and the sun is shining and my family are safe and happy all is well perhaps i could just stay here forever knowing my family had just over there happy better off without my being right there yes better that i am over here the water just a few steps away dr cooper in the woman's voice makes me jolt this isn't part of the recording dr cooper in their connection has been made now you need to end immersion,0
B07DY84QP2,before she spoke into it i watched her crimson lips moving i walked across the road knelt and touched the boy's forehead i stood up ignoring the shock on all those faces fixed on me they were reading me i knew studying my expression waiting perhaps for the hole that would confirm for them that this dead boy was family i did none of that i simply stood over him when the police came they rushed me the largest one slammed my back against the wall jammed the knee into my stomach and present elbow against my throat i choked on my breath and held his eyes he did not like that he threw me on the pavement dropped his weight on my spine then i dragged my hands behind my back and handcuffed me a little car arrived it stopped in the middle of the road an apparition got thought awaited of hair eyes like two knobs of flaming cause lips that would look perfect on a battered leather purse white hair shouted something the words came out of him like gravel on a greeter the weight came off my back i was lifted to my feet the handcuffs removed rough hands bundled me into the little car all the while people were out there protesting at my arrest all women the men remained silent they were no doubt less interested in my feet than in the when injustice takes it's course it made for better rum shop conversation they took me to an old brick building backing the bus terminal which stood over the scene above the entrance in big white type st andrews police central inside i caught the faint smell of tar from the island schooners birth against the jetty partitioned rooms retreated all the way to the back of the building from them came the shuffling of paper and occasionally that boom of men's voices outside the blasts of horns they rise and fall of market women's voices the penetrating brie of the coconut seller we called coco man amid the thunder of vehicles arriving in the concrete courtyard white hair sat me down in a chair by an untidy desk he pressed his sandwich into my hand and a glass of orange juice the lord himself in front of me and jabbed a finger to his chest detectives superintendent jill man yoked digger there's a pneumonia birth certificate michael dickson how long you been out there out where on the street i have a home all along eighteen months three days you been counting why keep my sanity he looked me in the eye you still got it you got no basis for arresting me calm down young fella you're not under arrest now talk to me one i pushed aside the sandwich and sipped the juice monkees demanding respect from humans i said they kill the human detective superintendent chill man leaned forward and squinted as if he were examining his speck in my eye you upset that's good you could point them out they hide their faces from the start before the argument is obvious the planet tillman rubbed his chin and looked up at the ceiling right he said rising to his feet come with me he stopped at the door and raised his voice or care fellas bring them out twenty three young men all in rubbers hoods rolled back from their heads filed out of three vans into the yard some look nervous some angry and most of them relaxed a few was so terrified they could barely walk a couple of them didn't drop the monkeys swagger the officers line them up against the wall of the building chill man prodded me recognize in it i shook my head let's try something else then on his word germans officers pulled the hoods over the young man,0
1518921450,the haze of dusk was a soft blanket over my green honda civic as i drove the familiar route to the los angeles airport how many times had i taken this freeway this accent on autopilot i change lanes smoothly and rounded the bend toward century boulevard i was going in the same direction i'd always gone but i might as well have been in a parallel universe to the one i lived in six years before driving down century i saw the sign in the distance the words live live nude nudes hung in muted orange and red nineteen seventies style lettering you'd think with all the razzle dazzle strip clubs popping up everywhere this one would wither and die and go back to being something more functional as it was when it was a bowling alley but it's still there and so are the girls i wondered about my old coworkers had they moved to other clubs or other lives or were they still there i remembered that life the suffocating feeling of being trapped with no end in sight wanting the money needing it but wishing there was some other legal way to get it the constant pressure to smile and pretend you want nothing more than to fulfill every wish and fantasy of a stranger when all you really want to do do is lie around your apartment and sweatpants watching mafia movies like goodfellas and casino imagining you could live some other life i remembered and all i could do was pray that the women behind those very walls feeling as i once did would have a real and true encounter with the loving gracious god of freedom and wonder that i have come to know that they would discover the beauty that lies within them that is more precious than the rare this gem that they would realize that the dreams of their youth and the passions of their hearts are important and within reach the driver in front of me gently pressed his brakes snapping me out of the trance i was in i glanced in my rear view mirror and saw that i had passed a taco bell parking lot i was planning to pull into instead i parked in a lot directly across the street from the club turn my car off and sat staring there are girls in there right now i thought what are you going to do a voice whispered to my heart what could i do i felt as though i was outside of a prison that had once held me captive i was free while there were still women feeling trapped inside there was a standoff i was still waiting for something to happen for the other guy for some other person to come up with something a solution an idea anything what are you going to do what can i do it's not like i can waltz up there and tell the bouncer i want to talk to the girls even if he did let me in what on earth what i say what do you want to say i glanced to my left and discovered a stack of postcards from a recent women's conference i had attended the woman pictured was facing away from the camera looking confidently ahead her back was draped with strands of pearls tattooed across the warm brown skin of her shoulder blades were the words her value far above rubies and pearls,1
B002V0A5K2,all my life i had one dream and that was to be in the movies maybe it was because i had a pretty rough childhood or perhaps it was because i was always more than a little insecure but as a kid i long to see myself ten feet tall on the big screen through no fault of my teachers i received almost no formal education but after i spent three years in the navy during world war two the g i bill allowed me to go to acting school and the government's nickel i may not have had much schooling but it turned out i had a gift for acting when i walked out on that stage it felt like a hand in a velvet glove i wasn't scared i wasn't even nervous i just loved being the center of attention just like i'd always known i would i performed in summer stock and i acted in clifford odets play golden boy exactly twice over a single weekend but before i knew it i had been summoned to meet a studio executive at universal studios it was the spring of nineteen forty eight i was excited but i was i'm surprised going to hollywood had been my life's plan since i could remember and i was too naive to know it almost never works out that way i got myself out to new york's idlewild airport now jfk and boarded a t w a super constellation the four engine prop plane bound for los angeles i had never been on a super constellation before but i knew all about it from movies and magazines i was served a little lunch the stewardesses were real nice to me one of them was very pretty so i had a chance to flirt i was just a kid but already i loved flirting mostly i succeeded in sparking some kind of response which is what i lived for on my first flight to raleigh i sat in coach in those days the sections weren't partitioned so i could see into first class where a man with a mustache and a herringbone suit was being tended to by what was clearly a personal assistant the guy in the suit would whisper something to the other man who would jump up and do his bidding to my surprise a little while after we took off the assistant came over and asked me could you join my friend and first class sure i said i got up and walked forward to herringbone suit i had no idea who he was but he was cordial and expressed interest in why i was going to l a i'm going to be an actor i figured you might be he said i've got a meeting at universal i said do you know anything about the other studios he asked i had heard the same hollywood gossip as everyone else but i had paid special attention to it knowing that this was where i would work on one day so i said warner brothers is a tough studio to work for twentieth century fox makes action pictures and mgm you have to sing and dance a little bit rk o wants actors who are stable and universal wants young people so that's where i'm going we talked for a few minutes and then i went back to my seat and fell asleep after we landed i went to pick up my luggage and there was herringbone suit waiting for his assistant to fetch his bags he saw me and said can i offer you a ride that would be great thanks i'm staying at the hollywood knickerbocker hotel well he said my driver will take me home first then he'll be happy to drop you off at your hotel we drove through the winding streets of beverly hills for a while before finally pulling up to a big metal gate barely visible through the trees and groomed shrubbery was a tasteful mansion after we pulled up to it and my benefactors bags were unloaded he reached over and shook my hand i said wow well he was a pleasure meeting you and thanks for the ride my name is bernie schwartz what's yours jack warner he said let me tell you something kid if universe deliver drops you come see me i'll change your name to tyrone goldfarb and make you a star all over the world we both laughed warner got out and his limo driver took me to the hollywood knickerbocker hotel where i slept like a baby the next morning i walked from the hotel to a big intersection at highland avenue where a trolley took me into the san fernando valley up the middle of the street ending up at universal studios after i got off i walked under a bridge with the freeway overhead until i came to the universal lot i walked right up to the gate now it was starting to hit me this was an absolutely thrilling experience for a twenty two year old kid fresh from the streets of new york my whole life i had dreamed of being an actor in a movie studio and here i was about to walk through the entrance of universal pictures as a prospective employee i pinched myself but the dream continued the gatekeeper told me to go to a door marked casting i walked through it and up to a big gleaming desk i've been invited to come to the studio for a meeting i said a girl behind the desk looked up at me and said what's your name bernie schwartz now i have my heart in my throat i thought suppose this is a big fucking joke i was pretty sure it had to be more than that because the studio had sent me a plane ticket but what was one hundred and twelve dollars to a movie studio so i held my breath for the long moment before she said yes and here you are on the list welcome to universal studios mister schwartz you have an appointment this morning with mr goldstein to get to his office turn right when you come out of the gate across from the barbershop go up the path and you'll see his name on the door,1
B0036G95D8,genghis khan eleven sixty two to twelve twenty seven the greatest happiness is to scatter your enemy to drive him before you to see his cities reduced to ashes to see those who love him shrouded in tears and to gather into your bosom his wives and daughters first came the refugees throngs of wide eyed petrified peasants flocked in from the outlying villages with outlandish tales that sounded like something out of a low budget horror flick crazy impossible stories of bloodthirsty demons on horseback riding forth from some intangible hell far beyond the eastern horizon seemingly materializing from the fog without warning and savagely laying waste to entire settlements invincible barbarian warriors committing acts of untold cruelty upon the unsuspecting citizenry slaughtering all those before them in a frenzy of blood and fire and then draw thinking they're chocolate milk right out of the carton the rumors had been circulating the bustling city for nearly a month now but most logical people believed them to be the nonsensical ramblings of rabble rousers fanboys crazy conspiracy theorists impressionable dumb asses and doomsayers stories of mysterious blood drinking cannibal sent by god to exact his cruel vengeance upon the sinful leaving nothing but death and ash in their wake using foul black magic to turn the mightiest armies in the world into bloody handfuls of dust and sand some claimed to have seen the massive piles of sun-bleached skulls arranged into three morbid pyramids outside the duke doomed city of nisha poor one stack for the men one for the women and one for the children reports claimed that over two million people had been massacred by these heathens in the span of weeks with thousands more carried off by savages to the darkest recesses of the earth never to be heard from again then came the devil's emissaries strange looking weirdos from a mysterious undiscovered civilization bearing a simple frightening message submit or be destroyed the high ranking members of the city's aristocracy pretentious self important tightwads unwilling to relinquish their near absolute power over their subjects responded by hanging the barbarians disembodied heads from the walls of the city they chose poorly just as the peasants had warned the devils came from nowhere ghostly apparitions seemingly rising out of the sand itself the thunderous din of stampeding hooves surrounded the terrified defenders on the city walls as an endless sea of horsemen descended upon them the men on the ramparts watched in horror as they realized that the first wave of soldiers was actually comprised entirely of captured villagers from the outlying settlements poor imprisoned farmers forced under pain of death to push forward massive siege engines catapult and ballista he assigned with the cruel task of bringing destruction and mayhem to their own kinsmen the soldiers were reluctantly opened fire on these wretched saps but even an endless stream of arrows couldn't stem the tide of heavy equipment being brought up to the massive moat surrounding the city to their amazement the defenders then saw the invading barbarians shoving their prisoners into the moat using their bodies as a living bridge over which they rolled their infernal contraptions the tower and catapults were then loaded with large foreign looking clay pots and when these projectiles smashed into the sturdy seemingly impenetrable stone walls and guard towers of the city they exploded into gyre ain't showers of searing hot flame sparks napalm and smoke rock crumbled to dust and walls fell as though they were made of cardboard utterly destroyed by this frightening evil magic conjured up from some nightmarish realm beyond the mortal world with a blood curdling cry the demons charged forth and hell followed with them,0
B00D9D3URU,growing up i didn't have holidays or special family events i could look forward to and memories to build upon the jehovah's witnesses don't believe in the traditional holidays they don't recognize easter or christmas but they do have a celebration that is commanded by god based upon their belief that corinthians eleven states that jesus christ gave his soul and his blood to mankind the ceremony is called the memorial and it falls on nissan fourteen in the jewish calendar which is the first full moon of the spring equinox that's the day the witnesses commemorate christ and his death because scripturally jesus said that it was not his birth but his death that should be remembered i always made every memorial service whether i was a gangster or not i wasn't feeling guilty i never asked god to get me out of the life i can't really explain why i went i was just drawn to it i always like to hear the passage about king david a biblical figure that i really had a passion for king david was a man who made many mistakes who slept with the wife of one of his most trusted men and then sent him away to war so that he would be killed it shows that an imperfect man can be redeemed i would always turn to that and the song of solomon and psalms to me is like a melody and in those brief moments when i would do fuck into a kingdom hall i would open the bible and read things like isaiah forty one i would remember sitting in the hall as a kid and reading that same passage in it god says i am your god of righteousness i will hold out my right hand of righteousness please grasp on and hold and i will hold you under my wing and i will know never forsake you that had great power for me god never forgets but always forgives no matter what you do in life if you understand that god is the spirit of love not just some entity that you are afraid of then god will be there to hold and he will be part of your life i lie loved the memorial it was the only time i would feel okay being alone but after it was over i would always go back to the streets i stayed in touch with the greek side to when i was a kid black spot had given me a thirty minute dissertation on greek superstitions and i continued to live by those beliefs the greeks believe that the walls have ears literally they believe that your enemies are always near and that anything you let come out of your mouth will eventually come back to haunt you greek mobsters are also deeply cynical they believe that in this business your only friend is yourself you can't even trust your own mother in greek life tuesdays are bad luck i tried not to do my business on tuesdays and it's bad luck to to see a priest walking down the street all these little things were drummed into my brain and i couldn't let them go the last superstition i followed was that if you're going to do a deal like if you're transporting drugs or http putting yourself in harm's way then the night before needs to be a night of meditation you don't go into a war zone being still have coke dub after partying until dawn all my men lived by that they never rolled in at four and then went out at seven to do a deal after all why tempt fate the drug game has hard enough as the drug game heated up in atlanta i tried to out think my rivals and the feds at the same time one example is drop points for the keys that we needed to get into the hands of one of our distributors the sanders brothers or mike the redneck might call their guys up and say come over and get your shit that was crazy me i needed something more secure i developed a sector system we gave all the neighborhoods that we operated in a number bulkhead was twenty one the airport was fifteen and so on and within those sectors we had payphones that we had designated with another number from one to ten those were our safe phones if i wanted to talk to you about a drop you'd get a message on your pager and all it would say is twenty one eight completely harmless from law enforcement point of view so you'd go to buckhead and go to the number eight phone booth and stay there until the phone rang we had all kinds of different codes on our pagers each product had a number her cocaine was eight pot was thirteen so if you got a message saying fifty one hundred one hundred thirteen that meant i need one hundred pounds of pot if we were talking about kilos we'd use one thousand because there's one thousand grams per key so if you did fifty one hundred eight two two thousand that meant that the group will bring you two kilos of coke if you wanted a specific kind of coke each one had a number,1

B003F667VM,at one time in our not so distant past the story of daisy bates was taught in every school in australia arriving in australia in eighteen eighty three with no money family or friends but with extraordinary pretensions this remarkable irish orphan somehow managed to marry three times bear a child live in victorian formality in a tent in the outback and become a pioneer ethnographer and documenta of aboriginal customs her initial research into west australian tribal ceremonies customs languages and kinship systems carried out at a time when the subjects of ethnology and anthropology were struggle ling to establish themselves as university disciplines was extremely valuable her important work the native tribes of western australia was not published until nineteen eighty five edited by anthropologist isabel white but her observations have underpinned much understanding of aboriginal society and helped aboriginal people regain their land daisy bates was an extraordinary and eccentric woman by any measure in two thousand and five she was nominated as one of the world's great female travel writers on the basis of her daring trick from the northeast of australia three thousand miles and a side saddle as scorching a mob of cattle south he had before this she had of course traveled on her own the thousands of miles from ireland by ship to an unknown continent on the other side of the world marrying the first of her three husbands none of whom she bothered to divorce the boer war soldier break him around the pair would go on separately to make themselves legends spinning fanciful tales about their pasts they nevertheless lived more astonishing real lives moran ending up before a firing squad and daisy eventually taking herself her tent and her young son to the bleak nullarbor desert all the while maintaining strict victorian dress if not morals for sixteen years she lived alongside australian aborigines befriending and studying them at the expense of her own health her restricted diet in a drought ridden desert without fresh vegetables led to a lack of essential vitamins and minerals and the breakdown in her health yeah but how many references to aboriginal cannibalism and her support for removing children from what she viewed as abusive conditions especially once alcohol took a toll within aboriginal societies and her support for a widely held belief in the ultimate extinction of the aborigines in australia meant her reputation suffered one of the earliest authors to document daisy bates his life was the journalist ernestine hill who collaborated with daisy bates from nineteen thirty two to write the story of this fascinating woman during this time daisy bates also opened some of her own history in my natives and i a series of articles published in the adelaide advertiser between nineteen thirty six and nineteen forty in both the account she gave ernestine hill whose kabale a personal meme wife daisy bates was published in nineteen seventy three and in my natives and i daisy bates described how she arrived in australia in eighteen eighty three as an orphan from ireland where she had grown up under the protection of an adoring father according to daisy some time after her gentleman father died she was cared for by the ultram family and dorset england where she was attended on by servants educated by a governess and taken on visits to balmoral castle since my natives and i much of the writing about daisy bates his childhood in ireland has been based on her youthful fantasies and often repeats or embroiderers the misinformation of previous biographies in nineteen seventy one elizabeth salter produced a biography of daisy daisy bates the great white queen of the never never yet she never visited baits his homeland,1
B00DL6GTDW,patrick had the gift of the gab as they say many listened christianity had arrived six hundred years later in eleven fifty five once the irish had been corralled into a more malleable state with a good dose of christian shame humiliation and fear pope adrian came along the first and only englishman never to hold the papacy he gave the entire island of ireland to the king of england king henry the second henry in turn bequeathed unto his son john the new moniker law de violent and john was welcome to hang on to his new title just as long as he kept paying adrian and the vatican an annual fee for the honor of retaining sold slavery rights of the irish people it was a sweet deal on john was just about as happy as a clam at high tide to throw the boys over at the vatican their yearly bone and fifteen thirty six henry the eighth had himself anointed the king of ireland by the irish parliament which was comprised at the time of a bunch of his english buddies and with the eighth decreed that all the irish chieftains must anglicized their names and that all of the english landowners who had arrived in ireland claiming all the best land up and down the cunt for themselves must now clear their estates of native irish workers of course this was impossible because the landowners needed to keep the irish on as slaves to work the land but the threat of banishment for even the slightest misstep was a wonderful little tool to keep the irish workers on their toes and productivity soared as you can imagine by this point the irish natives were getting a little restless and sixteen forty one there was a rebellion in the northern part of the country known as ulster and twelve thousand irish were slaughtered for their effort but they had stirred a nest of bees others throughout the country had been awakened to the possibility of defeating the english and ending the horror of living as slaves england got wind of the whispers and they sent oliver cromwell and his army across the channel to put an end to any buzzing in sixteen forty nine when cromwell first arrived in the town of drogheda he decided to make a name for himself right away he slaughtered two thousand six hundred people the entire population of the town i am persuaded that this is the righteous judgment of god upon those barbarous wretches he said f famously before rolling on down to wexford and repeating this act over the next ten years the population of irish natives was halved by sword starvation and disease the more than six hundred thousand were killed or died another one hundred thousand were shipped off into slavery in the west indies the handful of irish catholic still standing were denied voting rights and access to education and all of their foodstuffs were confiscated and shipped off to england then to put the icing on the cake all land belonging to irish catholics was confiscated and given to english protestants and that was that thirty years later there was so much wealth to be gained from the plunder of ireland's dairy meat and grain products that the english started scuffling among themselves for ownership rights king james the second who had been deposed from the english throne after producing a catholic heir made an attempt to win ireland back for himself from the hands of the new english king his successor william of orange james had the support of many irish who believed he would put an end to discriminatory english penal laws basically a set of english ish laws that forbad civil rights and housing to anyone accused of being a practicing catholic and restore irish sovereignty once and for all in july sixteen ninety the two armies met outside drogheda for the battle of the boyne and later in limerick to give it a lash william of orange was victorious even today the protestants of northern ireland orangemen celebrate the victory by erecting enormous bonfires and burning the irish national flag just to rub catholic noses in it every year on july twelfth things were quiet for a period after that thrashing but in secret the irish were regaining their strength and getting ready to take another crack at the throne and the rebellion of seventeen ninety eight another thirty thousand catholic irish were slaughtered in an uprising the great irish republican hero mr wolfe tone attempted a landing with a fleet of friendships and fourteen thousand french troops ready to join the fray against the english but they encountered such gale force storms off the coast of bantry bay county cork that they eventually had to turn back the uprising was quelled the english eventually caught mr wolfe tone on another,1

B004O3VF26,the history of mesopotamia remained mostly working class and i had the impression that gentrification was still rather hanging fire i got talking to someone who had been brought up just around the corner from the house my grandparents lived in he told me that it had always been a rough old neighborhood and he catalogued a few of the more interesting local murders my grandparents' house had four rooms apart from the kitchen and according to the ninety no one census there were two other couples also living there presumably each of these other couples occupied one of the rooms so my grandparents and their four teenage children must have been living in the two remaining rooms two adults and four adolescents in two rooms and all ten residents presumably sharing the kitchen all the friend children were fortunately a slight wispy creatures and they might have been packed in even tighter in the next census in nineteen eleven as a space for the total number of children born dead as well as living and this record two more born alive but with no names or birthdates so this was my first surprise as i looked into my father's origins quite how poor the family had been when he at last joined the household on the twenty ninth of january nineteen oh one he was the eleventh human being to be fitted into the forums and cooked for and washed for in the communal kitchen they named him thomas like his father and allen after his mother's family thomas alan friend tom to everyone is a boy then tommy to his wife's family in the years to come and tom still for some reason to all his colleagues and customers the benjamin with a big brother to look after him and three big sisters to fuss over him twelve years younger than the youngest of them i have only one photograph of him as a baby he's wearing a bib and he looks as if he has just made a great discovery the only thing that he told me about himself in these early years if you're given britain cheese you can eat the cheese and chuck the bread under the table no sooner onto his first salt food then he discovered the first inklings of the sharpness and cheek that we're going to see him through a career of salesmanship and so many of life's waiting difficulties parking his car in central london for example fifty years after this leaving it in front of the em industry and telling the attendant business with the minister or in front of the great north door of westminster abbey business with the dean my second surprise as i looked at the ninety one census came when i understood the significance of the final column in the return it was to be filled in it explained at the top if one deaf and dumb to blind three lunatic for imbecile feeble minded and it was filled in every single member of the family except for the two month old thomas was tagged with a one the entire family were deaf and dumb the first thing this shows is how cautiously you have to treat even the most apparently or authoritative historical records i never knew my paternal grandfather because he died long before i was born and i don't remember my grandmother because she died when i was still not two but i'm pretty sure that they weren't dumb and absolutely sure that my father's brother and sisters went because them i did know death if they certainly were all of them nellie mabel george and daisy seriously deaf i remember the struggled to make them hear anything i said i'm surprised though that they were already deaf as children my father's deafness came on in early middle age and his brother and sisters can't have been deaf from birth because their speech wasn't impaired or perhaps maples was a bit now i come to think of it she certainly spoke in a strangely hushed way as if she were in church so did daisy yes and nellie and george what they were all suffering from he was presumably as i have discovered from the internet late onset hereditary deafness for which apparently the gene has not been discovered though i'm not quite sure what's happened to it in the three generations since then a puzzle remains though if it's hereditary it's not surprising that one of the parents was also deaf but both of them was this pure coincidence,1

B009DM7MFW,and there to kill someone are you not yeah only the folks i'm sent to kill need kellen i wave the article at her through this thing say anyway i barely speak enough spanish to find the restroom says he's a fisherman died of natural causes and just yesterday at that he's as fresh as can be she added smiling sweetly fresh right just goes to show you should never trust a creature of the night turned out lois idea of natural causes included drowning this guide spent six hours in the drink before they found him washed ashore in a tangle of kelp a good three miles from where he'd gone overboard and cleaned up as best i could in the mortuary sink but no amount of scrubbing could erase the reek of low tide odd that clung to his hair his skin his course thicket of stubble still if lilla thought this guy would be enough to make me cave and snatch myself a living vessel she was sorely mistaken i'm nothing if not stubborn but the hassle with a meat suit was nothing compared to the job itself his name was pablo varela a major player in the local drug trade varela brutality was a matter of public record in the two decades he'd been involved in the trafficking of coca he'd only once been brought to trial it was seven years back and the colombian government had turned the trial into quite the spectacle tv radio the whole nine their way i guess of demonstrating their newfound dedication to the war on drugs varela declined counsel and mounted no defense after eight weeks of damning testimony from the prosecution it took the jury only minutes to acquit some say varela got to them that he threatened their lives and the lives of their families if they failed to set him free others claim he didn't have to that his reputation alone was enough to guarantee his real please whatever it was the jury made the right choice save for them everyone who set foot in the courtroom over the course of his trial was murdered every lawyer every witness every one some like the bailiff in the court reporter got off easy two bullets to the back of the head the judge and chief prosecco shooter weren't so lucky they were strung up by their entrails in the city square their throats slit their tongues yank through the gash in the colombian style one week later the courthouse burned to the ground now a guy like varela i don't much mind dispatching problem was the man was paranoid as soon as he caught wind that i was looking for him he sent a couple of his goons around to take care of me that didn't go so well for them so he sent a couple more i'm afraid they didn't fare much better that's when i slipped up see i'm not much for killing anyone i don't have to you could call it mercy i suppose or whatever passes for a conscience among the denizens of hell i call it stupidity because the bastard that i spared spelled his story to varela who grabbed a handful of his most trusted men not to mention enough firepower power to topple your average government and disappeared into the jungle not a bad play i'll admit hell the first day or so i even thought it was kind of cute but as the hours wore on and the rain continued unabated the whole affair sort of lost the shine now it had been four days since i left carter hana four grueling days of tracking varela and his men through blistering heat and near constant downpours without so much as a moment to eat or sleep or even catch my breath varela men were well trained and familiar with the terrain but they were also laden with gear and would no doubt stopped arrest so i was certain i could catch them still october is columbia's rainy season and during that rainy season there is not a wetter place on earth all i wanted was to turn around to find some nice secluded spot on the beach and watch the waves roll in off the caribbean through the bottom of a bottle of beer which is exactly what i intended to do just as soon as varela was dead woody robes of leanna hung low over the forest floor klein scratching winding themselves around my weary limbs as though they might at any moment retreat with me into the canopy the rare unwary traveler to delicious morsel,0
B00B90MTIG,old sick broke and depressed samuel langhorne clemens boarded the night train from elmira to cleveland on sunday july fourteenth eighteen ninety five he was five months short of his sixtieth birthday and advanced age in those days he had been bedridden for for weeks suffering from an immense carbuncle on his leg the publishing firm of which he was principal partner had collapsed the year before leaving huge unpaid debts and casting him into bankruptcy because he had failed as a businessman he felt he had failed as a father and husband as well to his wife olivia langdon clemens business failure meant disgrace she urged him to pay the firm's debts in full although he was not obliged to do so he received the same counsel from a surprising source his friend and admirer henry huddleston rodgers a piratical monstrously rich director of the standard oil trust if as many supposed trusts were satanic rogers sported two horns and a tail as a businessman he was ruthless rapacious and unscrupulous but he was a loyal generous and sensitive friend he took the clemens his financial affairs as in hand negotiated with creditors and publishers and saved the clemencies from ruin without injuring their pride clemens who revered and loved him listened when rogers told him that an author could afford to be poor in money but not in character so clemens was returning to the lecture circuit when he had left at ten years before he'd thought that he would never again suffer the noisy dusty bone shaking trains missed connections and boring small towns associated with an interminable succession of one night stands but a lecture tour was still here quickest means for raising money not only was he the international celebrity mark twain constantly interviewed and photographed whose mop of bushy hair tufted eyebrows and swooping mustache made him instantly recognizable he was also a superb platform entertainer cleveland and was to be the first stop in a year long tour that took him his wife and their second daughter clara to the pacific northwest fiji australia new zealand india ceylon mauritius and south africa one hundred years later to the day i i set out from elmira to follow them as a recently retired academic i'd been craving a long journey like huck finn all i wanted was to go somewheres all i wanted was a change a warrant particular paul thorough set the direction of this change in the introduction to a selection from his travel writings he listed following the equator mark twain's account of his world lecture tour as one of the few travel books he likes almost as soon as i began to read it i found a personal connection to the book my wife's grandmother once meant mark twain probably in nineteen oh one when she was eighteen years old a photograph from that period shows her looking at you over her shoulder half smiling half flirting standing slim and erect in a long white gown years later she would tell her grandchildren what she had said to the great man when she was introduced mister clemens i am not a bit embarrassed are you this so delighted him she would say that he kept her with him for several minutes to chat she never explained why the old man was pleased in the second chapter of following the equator clemens told about having been introduced years before to a taciturn president grant the president took his hand dropped it and then stood silent there was an awkward pause a dreary pause a horrible pause then i thought of something and looked up into that unyielding face and said timidly mr president i am embarrassed are you his face broke just a little wee glimmer the momentary flicker of a summer lightening smile and i was out and gone as soon as it was ten years later he was again introduced to grant before clements could think of an appropriate remark the general said mr clemens i am not embarrassed are you although this anecdote solved a family mystery it meant more to me than that suddenly the historical figure samuel clemens became human a man pleased by the subtle flattery of a pretty young woman suddenly the last turn of the century seemed not impossibly distant could i come closer to him and his times by following the clemens is one hundred years later along the route of mark twain's lecture tour i wanted to try i hoped to leave elmira on july fourteenth and complete the journey in cape town on july fifteenth of the next year as he did traveling by surface transportation wherever possible this vision did not enchant alice my wife she was not eager to rattle around the world for a year changing accommodations every third day boarding trains at five in the morning and wearing the same two blouses and skirts month after month on the other hand neither of us wanted a long separation we finally agreed that i would travel alone along the clemens is north american route during the summer of nineteen ninety five and that she would join me on the west coast in late august and accompany me for the rest of the journey but with one condition we would return twice to our home in jerusalem for about a month each time during the year long project before she could change her mind i flew to new york and from there found my way to elmira,1
B004Y6G1PY,there was a pain and stiffness at the back of his neck that rendered him incapable of moving his head without moving the rest of his body to like some awkward cardboard cut out the dryness in his mouth had moved on from sandpaper quality to the feeling of having been sand blasted his eyes stung as if he spent a couple of hours underwater in an over chlorinated pool and his digestion felt seriously at risk the jacuzzi of his stomach threatened to overflow at any moment and without warning of which direction that overflow might take his guts complained that their treatment with rumbles that wouldn't have sound out of place in the third rinse of a dishwasher cycle and a rumbling stomach doesn't help an audiobook recording either he could have tolerated the sickness of his body if his mind had not also been infected while his mouth continued to pronounce the swimming words on the page his mind seethed with self hatred and recrimination why on earth that he let himself get so drunk he must have been aware of the way he is going why hadn't he put a brake on it he was such a fool a man in his late fifties behaving like a teenager at his first grownup party and it was hideously unprofessional the worst insult that can be levelled at an actor for him to get so wasted the night before he was to start on a whole new area of work getting the contract to record an audiobook could be a breakthrough into a different and possibly lucrative market he mustn't screw it up at the bottom of all these anxieties lurking like some evil predator in the depths of a murky pool lay the question of what he had said the night before worse than that what he had done the night before cookie stone what had happened between him and cookie stone he knew the position in which they had found themselves at three fifteen but what had been the precise sequence of events that had led up to that various possibilities presented themselves one the most unlike clay was that they'd just gone to bed together for a cuddle mutual support for two lonely people and by agreement nothing else had happened a second scenario also he feared unlikely was that they had enjoyed a long session of abandoned passionate and satisfying love making the third and the one towards which he was unwillingly inclining was that they had prepared to make love or gone through all the soft talking and the anticipate very blandishments that they had started to make love and then that he had proved incapable of completing the process and fallen into a drunken stupor halfway through charles had a horrible feeling that that was what had happened but his memory could offer him no help on the subject his recollection of the previous night's events after their departure from the italian restaurant was to use the most generous adjective possible in the circumstances hazy and the hadn't been much chance in the morning for charles and cookie to compare notes he had woken in a sweat of panic at six thirty three suddenly aware that he was supposed to be catching the seven fifteen train from paddington to bath for the days recording in the rush of his own dressing and incomplete ablutions and of hurrying cookie through her reduced morning ritual there hadn't been any opportunity for an assessment or more likely a post mortem of the previous night's encounter they had parted with their stale mouths joining in a dry kiss and a cherry see you monday but no mention had been made of any relationship in which they might be considered to be involved and as so often after an unsatisfactory skirmish with a member of the opposite sex all charles could think about was his wife frances although there seemed almost nothing now left between them he still felt as if he had betrayed her there was even at the back of his mind the appalling thought that at some point during the events of the previous evening it found a message from francis on his answering machine surely that couldn't be true surely that was just the guilt getting at him even worse though was the fear that he had actually phoned his wife back just a quick call to establish contact and that she had said she wouldn't talk to him until he was sober,0

B01E4KDI0K,prologue a few weeks before i started writing this book i began thinking about traveling overseas again as a missionary i have a long list of places where i would like to travel and work however before i can travel to any other country for an extended period he'd have time i must obtain a visa every visa application includes the question have you ever been convicted of a crime the application does not ask if the conviction was justified or if the rest of the world condemned the imprisonment all it asks is have you ever been convicted of a crime i have to answer truthfully i must check the yes box the second question always follows the first if yes what was your crime i don't know how to answer if i tell the truth i don't think any country will grant me a visitor visa according to my prison record i am a terrorist charged with and convicted of plotting and working to overthrow the government of the democratic people's re republic of korea dprk also known as north korea after my arrest the prosecutor told me i was the most dangerous american criminal apprehended in the sixty years since the korean war permanently divided the korean peninsula if i had not been an american citizen i may have received the death penalty or at the very least life in prison with no possibility of parole instead i was sentenced to fifteen years of hard labor what did i do that posed such a danger to north korea what were my terrorist activities i am a missionary to the dprk government mean a missionary is the same as being a terrorist the terms are interchangeable as you will discover in the pages that follow the government finds the gospel of jesus christ to be very dangerous they understand that if they allow the message of jesus to spread their government will collapse along with every aspect of their society i was tried and convicted of plotting to overthrow the government even though i never gave away a single bible or held even one outreach service for the north korean people all i did was bring visitors into the country to pray for the north korean people that was enough to come evict me the communist regime and the dprk has always viewed christianity as a threat ironically before world war two when there was only one korea more christians lived in the north than the south a huge revival broke out in pyongyang and nineteen o seven with thousands of people coming to christ the revival earned young young the name jerusalem of the far east today very few people remember that revival ever took place all those who lived through it are long since dead by but god has not forgotten the work he wants dead there my crime was to walk through that land and pray god would do again what he wants dead that made me a terrorist and a dangerous criminal i guess i still am because i am still praying for north korea i love the north korean people and i hope to return there some day as you read my story you will get a glimpse of what life is like for average citizens in one of the most secretive nations on earth the people have not chosen this life they live in dark weakness completely cut off from the rest of the world all they know all they believe is the propaganda that comes at them all day every day through their radios and televisions and schools and newspapers and every other information outlet they have forgotten life before the days of their great leader life when the light once shown as you read the story that follows i pray that you too will fall in love with the north korean people they have no voice but together we can be that voice god has not forgotten the north korean people i write this,1
B004OFL3KI,for her birthday last year a fellow student had given her a little book called the worst case scenario a guide to survival it was intended as a jab at graduate school but casey had read it cover to cover the author stressed four important points for survival shelter food water fire in order of importance so first shelter struggling to her feet she took a critical look at her surroundings the beach stretched along a small clear stream that rambled down from the sandstone cliffs like a spill of broken glass class eventually finding a path into the river at the moment the beach was partly underwater but bits of grass poking up here and there hinted at it's normal contour beyond the beach terraced ledges stepped up to the canyon walls casey spied a dirt path obviously she wasn't the first human to tread here and was relieved to see that it led to a large open cavern hollowed out in the canyon walls she picked up her backpack and plodded up to the cavern it was larger than it looked from below probably twenty feet tall but wide and shallow a bowl shaped depression scooped out from the rock eons ago the cavern walls a smooth pinkish gold sandstone with long curving swirls and striations gave off the specific smell of the river an unlikely mix of dust and dampness in the back of the cavern where it sloped down to meet the floor ledges of sands stone poked out like shelves waiting to be filled good this is good it was too open to be snug but coupled with her tent would keep her dry if it rained she glanced at the sky it was clear now but the wind was picking up and a dark line of clouds probably the source of the flash flood stained the northern horizon sooner or later shelter might be needed,0

B078HFTG24,but he could see resolve built into the tension of her shoulders for now he'd let her set the agenda the hug was businesslike and i said you killed people how could you why would you do that it imagined writing her a series of letters so she'd have an understanding of his life and what had brought him to criminality it explain how he'd been bullied and stood over all his life tried to do the right thing for so long but he never got around to sending those letters and there in the room with him she wanted to know so he began with the story just the start of himself as a young boy and his mother glenda his mother the despot that died only a few months before after all the booze and the pills and then the strokes and the surgery it was a miracle the brain aneurism had waited so long the climber the prison so i could come in and told him she was dead and waited for a reaction which never came he felt nothing not even a glimmer of satisfaction at the death of this woman he'd learned a height with a vengeance now that she was gone he had no reservations about speaking of her disposition and for from there he planned to explain to penny why he later came to despise all bullies for exercising power over others but he never made it that far how can you sit there and make excuses for yourself penny said he could have explained it to her why describing the origins of his criminality was different to making excuses for it but he said didn't want to hear it why should he have to bend over backwards well if you don't want to know don't ask he said the face turned the granite and he shrugged his shoulders at her silence he knew it was his stubborn streak but the moment he doubted those words the decision had been set in stone and he couldn't go back now so has your mother he asked still crazy she shook her head at him incredulous and changed the subject then it was small talk news about the rest of the family university she was passing law with flying colors and he made all the right noises and now he could almost pretend that this girl is this woman was part of his life and even that she was pleased to be in his company she taught him more about her life another world and their surroundings fell away he saw the strengthen her she'd be ok at the end of the hour they stood and she hugged him briefly a kiss on the cheek and a final sizing up and when she turned to go long by snapped back into focus like a flashbulb and enveloped him now he said wiping his spectacles in his blurry cell and put her from his mind turned on the tv for the background noise pop one when people look at the dangerous violent criminal at the beginning of his development process rather than at the very end of it they will see perhaps unexpectedly that the dangerous violent criminal began as a relatively benign human being for whom they would probably have me more sympathy than antipathy lonnie athens the creation of dangerous violent criminals one the rabbit never had a name the boy's mom was at the pub and his gran was having a lie down and when he was alone with maxi like this the backyard was the dominion it was max's idea to take the rabbit out of it's case to play with they chased the white floppy rabbit around the yard it was slow fat from being cage bound but still fast enough to elude the boys grasping hands when hop between the smaller boy's feet he stifled the shriek not wanting to wait grain two small boys with identical eyes pile like the rabbits thy maxis hair was dark and the small boys red both had squarish heads framed by curls and with a similar set of their mouths they could be mistaken for brothers but maxie was the other boy's uncle barely two years older midafternoon light,1
B06XKT74S3,who in the mid fifties had gone in the space of thirty months from high school graduation to the top of the world's record charts and who through television had gone on to provoke national and then international outrage and devotion with music the shortest route to the emotions singing stars regularly come and go in short flushes of excitement but there was something about his voice his attitude his shy smile his boyish beauty the movements of his body as he sang his sex appeal and he his story that stuck in the public's imagination it still sticks making him the ultimate and forty years after his death the most enduring of american icons as a boy he'd dreamed that success would free him and his family from poverty but then he discovered that fame on his level imprisoned as well as released he wasn't the first rock and roll singer but he was the first rock superstar a status which meant that not only was there no one from whose experience he could learn but also there was no one with whom he could share the burden of being himself of being elvis throughout his life he would often say that he'd always felt lonely that was understandable no one other than he knew what it was like to be under the relentless glare of devotion and attention to be the alchemist who could turn music into so much love and so much go gold his ambition had been to become rich and famous his extraordinary two and a half octave voice with another level in falsetto had achieved that and more for him but when he left the stage when the cameras were turned away and the spotlight was switched off what then where where did he fit in nowhere impossible to categorize outrageous celebrity locked him out of any semblance of the real world and as the years passed he retreated to his court whether it was at his graceland mansion home in memphis or in hollywood or las vegas where his courtiers would cost him in his fears insecurities and depression by the time of that night in binghamton with kathy westmoreland just fourteen weeks before his death he was mentally broken emotionally spent how could he have fallen into this state of despair what had gone wrong for the man blessed with so many gifts and talents from the outside he seemed to have it all but looking out at the adoring fans one night some months earlier he had said bleakly to one of his staff those people don't love me in a personal way they don't know what's inside me they couldn't but had they been able to see inside his mind what would they have found most likely a multiple pile up of warring desires duties and pressures by then his past had been in endless conflict with his present for over twenty years his dreams blunted by brutish reality has his artistic ambitions lost out to his needs and to the demands of his manager and himself for an endless supply of money on film and stage he displayed a charming bravura but that was a mask behind which he hid his fears and weaknesses would his fans stay loyal the older he got he wondered aloud in those final months he dreaded their desertion and what they would think when they learned about his darker secrets then there were his more private worries what about his pathological spending sprees he knew huh in his more sanguine moments that they were ruining him but he couldn't control them what he soon ran out of money his father thought it possible unable to stop himself pd there spent much of his fortune or given it away and then there was his greatest fear the record nightmare that he would soon be forced to sell his home graceland and would one day end up back where he'd started dirt poor again remembered only as a washed up has been or worse a pathetic joke from the very beginning the enigma that was elvis the poor white boy,1

B00CS86B5K,i stand up and looked down at the bed holding my breath in fear of the sounds that are escalating from deep within my throat i will not cry i will not cry slowly sinking to my knees i place my hands on the edge of the bed and run my fingers over the yellow stars poured across the deep blue background of the comforter i stare at the stars until they begin to blur from the tears that are clouding my vision i squeeze my eyes shut and bury my head into the bed grabbing fistfuls of the blanket my shoulders begin to shake as the sobs i've been trying to contain violently break out of me with one swift movement i stand up scream and rip the blanket off the bed throwing it across the room i ball my fists and frantically look around for something else to throw i grabbed the pillows off the bed and chuck them at the reflection in the mirror of the girl i no longer know i watched as the girl in the mirror stares back at me sobbing pathetically the weakness in her tears infuriates me we begin to run toward each other until our fists collide against the glass smashing the mirror i watch as she falls into a million shiny pieces onto the carpet it i grip the edges of the dresser and push it sideways letting out another scream that has been pent up for way too long when the dresser comes to rest on it's back i rip open the drawers and throw the contents across the room spinning and throwing and kicking at everything in my path i grab at the sheer blue curtain panels fs and yank them until the rod snaps and the curtains fall around me i reach over to the boxes piled high in the corner and without even knowing what's inside i take the top one and throw it against the wall with as much force as my five foot three inch frame can muster i hate you i cry i hate you i hate you i hate you i'm throwing whatever i can find in front of me at whatever else i can find in front of me every time i open my mouth to scream i taste the salt from the tears that are streaming down my cheeks holder's arms suddenly engulfed me from behind and gripped me so tightly i become immobile i jerk and toss and scream some more until my actions are no longer thought out there just reactions stop he says calmly against my ear unwilling to release me i hear him but i pretend not to or i just don't care i continue to struggle against his grasp but he only tightened his grip don't touch me i yell at the top of my lungs clawing at his arms again it doesn't faze him don't touch me please please please the small voice echoes in my mind and i immediately become limp in his arms i become weaker as my tears grow stronger consuming me i become nothing more than a vessel for the tears that won't stop shedding i am weak and i'm letting him win holder loosens his grip around me and places his hands on my shoulders then turns me around to face him i can't even look at him i melt against his chest from exhaustion and defeat taking in fistfuls of his shirt as i sob my cheek pressed against his heart he places his hand on the back of my head and lowers his mouth to my ear sky his voice is steady and unaffected you need to leave now,0
197734979X,add furthermore the young faces before me were uniformly in expressive of any kind of emotional reaction to my entrance through that side door marked exit in fact the only face that betrayed a real interest was that of the dog i am not much good at disguising my feelings and after a few moments i abandoned all pretense of feeling less dejection than i felt i was talking i was making these tired old jokes that come off like the destitute man's bob hopeless at an encampment in some failed war i found myself sinking lower in the folding chair and that slumped position combined with fits of wheezing sniffling and coughing encouraged some of the small assemblage to get up and walk out on me me a thing that stirred in my heart no sense of the favorably providential still i continued to hear myself talking but no longer telling old jokes i heard myself describing an encounter then quite recent with a fellow playwright in the oak room bar at manhattan's plaza hotel i told them that this encounter had been inadvertent on both his part and mine but since he happened to be my old friend gaul vida i had embraced him warmly however mr v dal is not a gentleman to be disarmed by a cordial embrace and when in response to his perfunctory inquiries about the progress of rehearsals of outcry at told him that it's two performers michael york and kara duff mccormick and the director peter glenville and the producer david merrick all seemed a dream come true after many precedent nightmares he smiled at me with a sort of rueful benevolence johnson said well bored it won't do much good i'm afraid you've had too much bad personal exposure for anything to help you much any more well then for the first time i could see a flicker of interest in the young faces before me it may have been the magic word vida or it may have been his prophecy of my professional doom at any rate a young lady student of drama in the diminished group stood up to ask me if i regarded gore's assessment of my present situation in my profession here in the states as a reliable one i looked at her in silence for a moment while wondering if i did so regarded and i came to no conclusion about the question my eyes drifted from her face to that of the young man in the front row with the big black dog in his lap laughter has always been my substitute for lamentation and i laugh as loudly as i would lament if i hadn't discovered a useful substitute for weeping usually i laugh longer than i should as well as more loudly than i should this time i cut short my travesty of mirth and said to the young lady ask the dog the truth is that i don't know whether or not i can ever again receive a persuasively a favorable critical response to my theatre work in this country i know the answer no more than does the dog but i am not embittered nor even greatly disconcerted by this dilemma in which i find myself in a way it does seem that i have almost asked for it there is a duality in my attitude toward an audience now of course i want their approval i want there and standing and their empathy but there is much about them that strikes me as op directly resistant to my kind of theater these days they seem to be conditioned to a kind of theater which is quite different from the kind i wish to practice actually my own theater is also in a state of revolution,1

B06Y3WXW66,wooster extraordinaire a man who had won several fortunes lost them and won them back again chapter one a frenchman in the making the man who broke the bank at monte carlo charles deville wells was born at broxbourne in the county of hertfordshire england on the twentieth of april eighteen forty one the law dictated that births had to be registered within six weeks but it was not until the twenty eighth of may that charles's father finally got around to completing this formality with only days to spare charles wells sr was a man who found it difficult to get around to doing anything much except hunting shooting boating catching fish and keeping bees and he only kept bees because as one of his friends claimed while the bees were working he could be fishing charles's father his full name was charles jeremiah wells was born in london in january seventeen ninety nine the son of a well to do merchant he grew into a striking young man with sparkling blue eyes red curls and bluff rather blouse a complexion a bright quick most pecan lad overflowing with wit and humor at school he made friends with another pupil john keats who was destined to become one of the most illustrious of all english poets wells had literary ambitions of his own and the two young men talked incessantly about writing and poetry wells once sent some flowers to keats who responded by dedicating a song on it to wells but when orwell's thy roses came to me my sense with their deliciousness was spelled soft voices had they that with tender plea whispered of peace and truth and friendliness and quelled as a young adult charles jeremiah wells gained a reputation as napoleon noisy extrovert whose high spirits sometimes got the better of his judgment when he was about twenty he played a mischievous trick on john keats his younger brother tom he faked a series of love letters from an imaginary girl earl who is supposed to have fallen for tom the prank backfired tom's disappointment on finding that there was in fact no female admirer upset him considerably and there was a complication tom had been diagnosed with tuberculosis and died soon afterwards john keith space the entire blame for his brother's death on wells that degraded wells he wrote i do not think death too bad for the villain i will harm him all i possibly can in an attempt to regain john's trust wells wrote an epic poem joseph and his brethren it's similar in style to keats his own writing and perhaps wells had intended to flatter his friend i wrote it in six weeks to compel keats to esteem me and admit my power he later wrote for we had quarreled and everybody who knew him must feel i was in fault in fact it seems that john keats never spoke to him or even referred to him ever again although charles jeremiah wells was set on pursuing a literary career his parents forced him against his will to train as a lawyer but he found the work dull and unsuited to his adventurous spirit by day he worked with covenants conveyances deeds and affidavits by knights he corrals with newfound literary for since you included the poet william hazlitt the pair used to get very drunk together every night around eighteen twenty three two eighteen twenty four wells decided to publish joseph and his brethren but the book buying public ignored it completely it was a rejection that wells never really recovered from in eighteen twenty five he married emily jane hill the daughter of a teacher who ran a boarding and day school at broxbourne no description of her seems to have survived but a letter that she wrote in later life displays as we might expect of a teacher's daughter beautifully formed handwriting in contrast with her husband's spy cidery scroll and equally pristine spelling and grammar the overall impression regain is of a pleasant mild mannered and self effacing woman perhaps inclined to be a little fussy and preoccupied with detail accuracy and correctness or to put it another way she and her husband were two very different individuals charles was creative lackadaisical unscrupulous extroverted and sometimes overbearing,1
B013TBCV1W,both had good jobs in sydney my father ted worked for a local publishing company and then later for the reader's digest he was handsome with jet black hair swept into place with brylcreem rather like the don draper character in madman my mother the court herself bunty worked as an art publicist mainly for the australian opera and the australian ballet she was blonde vivacious and would dress stylishly in bright designer clothes my mother and father didn't really behave like parents to me or as partners to each other is more a case of too self involved individuals who happen to rent a room to a border of mister finally modest height they or rather we lived in a two story house of normal size with a circular drive squeezed into the front yard as a nod to feudal grandeur it had a pool out the back and a long bright sun room for entertaining the sun room had a bar at one end decorated to to an hawaiian same a pair of oversized salad servers embellished with fringe pennies was mounted on the wall behind the bar presumably to celebrate hawaii's famous love of salad a glass ball held packets of motel matches stay at the sea breeze on queensland's gold coast and there were several large lighters embedded in lumps of marble which are occasionally be required to carry around igniting the cigarettes of guests in this hassle there'd be no problems if a visitor craved either a drink or a smoke my parents worked hard and enjoyed a busy social life that arrive home just before dinner and then quite often would head to a party or the theater clambering their way up the social ladder leaving me with a teenage babysitter or the host elaborate dinner parties a clatter of music and conversation floating up the stairs towards my bedroom at such events my mother spoke loudly in a posh strangulated accent she sounded like the queen mum if the queen mum had been required to instruct a group of slightly deaf workmen standing on the other side of a noisy road it wasn't only the manner of speaking it was the woods themselves words i now realize which were chosen to prove her aristocratic standing it was never toilet but always a lavatory i'm just off to the laboratory she'd announce at high volume almost constantly the whole room fulls of people safe frequently that a guest must have been worried about the state of her bladder in the same spirit it was napkin not soviet sofa not couch pudding not sweet spectacles not glasses and drawing room not lounge my childhood was a blizzard of these terms my mother never more player jd then when she could work several into a single sentence let's head into the drawing room for some pudding if you're all sure you don't need the laboratory leave your napkin behind you won't need it once you're sitting on the sofa in the drawing room the lavatory is just through there past the sofa you'll see the way through your spectacles when i read autobiographies i am amazed by people's ability to recall their early childhood the film star die and chill into for example write about the music teacher she had when she was eight or nine years old and remembered everything the teacher's name per personality even the state of her teeth theodore benson was a dark haired melancholic with chipped teeth and moles all over her face was diane just making this up do most people retain the stuff i try to recall my own piano teacher but can't get a picture to form either in terms of the malls or the name i can certainly remember the long bicycle ride to the teacher's house and the steep upward slope just before i got there i rim member the rush of pleasure as i washed back down the hill at the end of the lesson also recall the music teacher's house double fronted with a long corridor to the back room where the piano stood and the musty cavity smell of the place and the boredom other than that nothing i can't even recall the gender of the teacher never mind supply a detailed dental report,1
B002V1OF4I,with delicate noses and hutus are short and stocky with wider noses but most people in rwanda fit neither description this divide is mostly artificial or left over from history but people take it very seriously and the two groups have been living uneasily alongside each other for more than five hundred years you might say the divide also lives inside of me i am the son of a hutu farmer and his tootsie wife my family cared not the least bit about this when i was growing up but since bloodlines are passed through the father in rwanda i am technically a hutu i married a tutsi woman whom i love with a fierce passion and we had a child of mixed descent together this type of blended family is typical in rwanda even with a long history of racial prejudice very often we can tell each other apart just by looking at one another but the difference between hutu and tutsi means everything in rwanda in the late spring and early summer of nineteen ninety four it meant the difference between life and death between april sixth when the plane of president juvenal habyarimana was shot down with a missile and july fourth when the tutsi rebel army captured the capital of kigali approximately eight hundred thousand rwandans were slaughtered this is a number that cannot be grasped with the rational mind it is like trying all at once to understand that the earth is surrounded by billions of balls of gas just like our sun across a vast blackness you cannot understand the magnitude ge just try eight hundred thousand lives snuffed out in one hundred days that's eight thousand lives a day more than five lives per minute each one of those lives was like a little world in itself some person who laughed and cried and eight and thought and felt and hurt just like any other person just like you and me a mother's child everyone in replaceable and the way they died i can't bear to think about it for long many went slowly from slash wounds watching their own blood gathered in pools in the dirt perhaps looking at their own severed limbs oftentimes with the screams of their parents or their children or their husbands in their ears their bodies were cast aside like garbage left to rot in the sun shoveled into mass graves with bulldozers when it was all over it was not the largest genocide in the history of the world but it was the fastest and most efficient at the end the best you can say is that my hotel saved about four hours worth of people take four hours away from one hundred days and you have an idea of just how little i was able to accomplish against the grand design what did i have to work with i had a five storey building i had a cooler full of drinks i had a small stack of cash in the safe and i had a working telephone and i had my tongue it wasn't much anybody with a gun or a machete could have taken these things away from me quite easily my disappearance and that of my family would have barely been noticed in the torrents of blood coursing to rwanda in those months our bodies would have joined the thousands in the east running rivers floating toward lake victoria their skins turning white with water rut i wonder today what exactly it was that allowed me to stop the killing clock for four hours there were a few things in my favor but they do not explain everything i was a hutu because my father was hutu and this gave me a certain amount of protection against immediate execution but it was not only tutsis who were slaughtered in the genocide it was also the thousands of moderate hutus who were suspected of sympathizing with or even helping the tutsi cockroaches i was certainly one of these cockroach lovers under the standards of mad extremism at work then i was a prime candidate for a beheading another surface advantage i had control of a luxury hotel which was one of the few places during the genocide that had the image of being protected by soldiers but the important word in that sentence is image in the opening days of the slaughter the uni united nations had left four unarmed soldiers staying at the hotel as guests this was a symbolic gesture i was also able to bargain for the service of five kigali policeman but i knew these men were like a wall of tissue paper standing between us and a flash flood i remembered all too well what had happened at a place called the official technical school in a suburb called chichi chiro where nearly two thousand terrified refugees had gathered because there was a small detachment of united nation soldiers staying there the refugees thought and i don't blame them that the blue helmets of the un would save them from the mobs and their machetes but after all the foreign nationals at the school were put onto airplanes safely the belgians themselves left the country leaving behind a huge crowd louder refugees begging for protection even begging to be shot in the head so they wouldn't have to face the machetes the killing and dismemberment started just minutes later it would have been better if the soldiers had never been there to offer the illusion of safety even the vaguest rumor of rescue had been fatal to those on the wrong side of the racial divide they had clustered in one spot and made it easy for the executioners to find them and i knew my hotel could become an abattoir just like that school yet another of my advantages was a very strange one i knew many of the architects of the genocide and had been friendly with them it was in a way part of my job i was the general manager of a hotel called the diplomat but i was eventually asked to take charge of a sister property the nearby hotel mille collines where most of the events described in this book took place the mille collines was the place in kigali where the power classes of rwanda came to meet western businessmen and dignitaries before the killing started i had shared drinks with most of these men serve them complementary plates of lobster lit their cigarettes i knew the names of their wives and their children i had stored up a large bank of favors i cash them all in and then borrowed heavily during the genocide my pre-existing friendship with general augustin busy mungo in particular helps save the meal colleen from being read it many times over but alliances always shift particularly in the chaos of war and i knew my supply of liquor and favors would run dry in some crucial quarters before the one hundred days were over a squad of soldiers was dispatched to kill me i survived only after a desperate half hour during which i called in even more favors all these things helped me during the genocide but they don't explain everything let me tell you what i think was the most important thing of all i will never forget walking out of my house the first day of the killings there were people in the streets who i had known for seven years neighbors of mine who had come over to our place for our regular sunday cookouts these people were wearing military uniforms that had been handed out by the militia sure they were holding machetes and were trying to get inside the houses of those they knew to be tootsie those who had tootsie relatives or those who refused to go along with the murders there was one man in particular whom i will call peter though that is not his real name he was a truck driver about thirty years old with a young wife the best word i can use to describe him is an american word cool peter was just a cool guy so nice to children very gentle kind of a kitty but never mean with his humor i saw him that morning wearing a military uniform and holding a machete dripping in blood watching this happen in my own neighborhood was like looking up at a blue summer sky and seeing it suddenly turning to purple,1

B07JBKF2Q7,the enduring image of world war one is of men stuck in muddy trenches and our vast armies dead locked in a fight neither could win it was a war of barbed wire poison gas and horrific losses as officers led their troops en masse charges across no man's land and into a hill of bullets while these impressions are all too true they hide the fact that trench warfare was dynamic and constantly evolving throughout the war as all armies struggled to find a way to break through the opposing lines though world war one is almost synonymous with trench warfare that method of combat was nothing new there had been extensive use of trenches during the later stages of the american civil war eighteen sixty four to eighteen sixty five and trench warfare was constant during the second boer war eighteen ninety nine to ninety no to the rosseau japanese war ninety to fall to ninety no five and the balkan wars nineteen twelve to nineteen thirteen in these conflict showed that modern firepower combined with entrenched positions gave a decisive advantage to the defender yet european observers failed to learn any lessons from these conflicts and the scale of trench warfare in world war one far eclipsed anything seen before or since especially on the western front since the industrial revolution arms and material output had increased by orders of magnitude as had the quality and uniformity of the products several developments had already taken place in the years building up to the conflict stepping-stones towards the vast escalation in middlebury innovation which took place immediately prior two and during world war one chief among these was the invention of smokeless gunpowder which took place concurrently among several powers between eighty ninety and ninety no five this was a crucial development as it eliminated the literal fog of war which in vast quantities obscured the battlefield in entirely and on an individual level both gave way the position of marksmen and made it possible for them to fire accurately unless they moved away from their own smoke cloud further innovations included the adoption into surface of the first belt fed machine guns predecessors of those which would wreak such slaughter in the trenches and the development of canon which did not row backwards after each shot as the nineteenth century pieces did but remained fixed in place the arms race before the war and the attempt to break the deadlock of the western and eastern france by any means possible changed the face of battle in ways that would have previously been deemed unsafe thinkable before nineteen fourteen flying machines were objects of public curiosity the first flights of any account on rotor aircraft have been made less than five years before and were considered to be the province of daredevils and lunatics by nineteen eighteen all the great powers were fielding squadrons of fighting aircraft armed with machine guns and bombs to say nothing of light reconnaissance planes tanks a common feature on the battlefield by nineteen eighteen had not previously existed outside of the realm of science fiction stories written by authors like h g wells machine guns had gone from being heavy cumbersome pieces with elaborate water coup adding systems to single man portable magazine fed affairs like the scioscia the lewis gun and the m nineteen eighteen bar to these grim innovations were added flame throwers hand grenades zeppelins observation balloons poison gas and other improvements or inventions that revolutionized the face of warfare,0
B009G4JONK,meanwhile it seemed every day brought more troubling news regarding watergate by april of nineteen seventy four one conservative ally senator barry goldwater was bluntly questioning the president's judgment and another senator james l buckley was openly calling for his resignation on the evening of april twenty nine nineteen seventy four the president told the nation that he would at long last released transcripts edited it turned out of several of the conversations recorded in his office by means of an electronic taping system similar to those used by his recent predecessors president nixon the student of history had recorded most of his important personal and telephonic conversations and those discussions which the president obviously presumed were confidential became perpetual fodder for his enemies the release of edited transcripts however had the effect of giving a shark a taste of blood and ultimately resulted in a full fledged political feeding frenzy the cabinet viewed the crisis as a call to arms and struggled with great success to continue the administration's policies and initiatives and keep the government functioning but outside the white house the mood was hostile and ugly with congress behaving more like a lynch mob than the dignified body it ought to be and with politicians eagerly interrogating anyone from the administration they could get to appear before a committee everything and everyone in the administration seemed ripe for investigation from my perspective i had work to do and couldn't be bothered with occurrences which i had absolutely no connection or control the closest i came to direct involvement in watergate was when an aide informed me in the spring of nineteen seventy four that piles of tapes had been discovered in a broom closet at the treasury building i immediately ordered a secret service agent to guard the closet and called al haig and told him about the tapes,1

B00A42XNAI,that you are going to pinkerton i told you several weeks ago that i was going the rabbi remarked oh i knew you were going to hold sabbath services for some hillel group but i didn't realize you were going to mass state and pinkerton it just goes to show you what a small world it is my steward is there oh really i didn't know that look i thought maybe you'd say hello for us and but of course mr garfinkel i'm sure he'll come to your service but just in case he gets tied up maybe if you took his phone number of course just a minute let me get a piece of paper he jotted down the number it's a dormitory so if he's not there you can leave a message i understand if you call him when you get in maybe he could show you around the campus that's an idea he was aware of a voice in the background and garfinkle said just a minute rabbi then after an interval of muffled sounds through the covered receiver of course he may have a class in the afternoon or having some studying to do the rabbi smiled to himself mrs garfinkel must have pointed out that their son might not like the idea of being saddled with the rabbi and his family for the afternoon that's all right we'll probably be pretty tired after our trip and will want to rest up well at a thought anyway when are you coming back rabbi saturday night right after have dollar really goldfinger sounded surprised i thought stewart said he sounded his hearty self again well anyway it just occurred to me yes the rabbi felt sure that he was now to hear the real reason for the call if you've got room in your car if it's not crowding you are inconveniencing you in any way you see stewart will be coming home for passover and they've got a week's vacation that i could give him a lift back only if it wouldn't be any trouble to you i'd be very happy to mister garfinkel he had no sooner hung up when there was a rap on the door and without waiting to be invited in came morton brooks the principal of the religious school he was a bouncy youngish man of forty with a kind of theatrical flamboyance about him thank god i caught you before your left when i got the call i came right over what it happened arlene feldman broke out with measles the doctor was over last night but mrs feldman didn't think to notify me until this morning he sounded betrayed eileen fell burgh brooks nervously fingered the long strands of hair that he had carefully combed to cover an incipient bald spot you know eileen felled burgh the little girl from the first grade who supposed to say the four questions in english at the seder oh harry failed berg's child well that's all right the rabbi was considerably relieved for a moment he had thought the principal was concerned about a possible epidemic the haggadah were using have the english translation on the opposite page or i suppose the little boy what's his name jeffrey blumenthal i'm sure jeffrey can give the translation after he read it in the hebrew impossible rabbi you mean he doesn't know what the hebrew means of course he knows said brooks indignantly but there's a big difference between reading and being able to recite it without adequate rehearsal but even if there were time to coach him properly it's still him possible in fact it would be adding insult to injury to let him have both parts that failed briggs would never forgive me and they'd talk about it to their friends and they include the paths and the idle stones i assure you rabbi we'd never hear the end of it i see and jeffery is a blumenthal of course friends of the garfinkel is the epstein's and the brennan's their cousins of the brennan's in fact oh come on morton isn't that rather silly not at all said the principal gravely believe me rabbi this is my third school and i know how these things work if you don't mind my saying so i think you would be wise to pay a little more attention to the politics in the congregation you attend the board meetings regular early but the important developments take place in the school that's where it really shows up in the religious school the rabbi made no attempt to hide his amusement of course the high holidays are once a year and the lesser holidays if they fall during the middle of the week we don't get more than seventy five attending services like on friday nights but the school the kids go three times a week and they report anything that happens the minute they get home you know how we'd use feel about our kids any little slight or fancied unfairness you'd think from the way the parents carry on it was a pogrom the rabbi smiled so what do you wanted,0

B002V8LDE6,that divided and delineated the united states the epitome of the historian he had in mind was professor hermann von holst who earlier that year had published the seventh and final volume of his monumental work the constitutional and political history of the united states in his history holst a concentrated upon the powers contained within state and national frontiers arguing that the unique character of the united states emerged from the bitter fight for constitutional dominance between state and federal governments it was this perspective on american history that the article in the aegis attacked it condemned the attention paid to state boundaries and to the sectional lines of north and south and argued that the united states owed it's unique character to the influence of another less formal frontier the line of settlement that stretched along the western border like a chord of union seven months later on july twelfth eighteen ninety three the writer frederick jackson turner professor of history at the university of wisconsin presented his thesis to a wider audience the american historical association in chicago under a title that was to become famous the significance of the frontier in american history the san isidro crossing represents everything that turner set out to bury the american frontier is sharply distinguished from the european frontier a fortified boundary line running through dense populations he insisted the most signify second thing about the american frontier is that it lies at the hither edge of free land it was here that the american character was formed turner argued whatever their national origin the settlers became infected with the frontier spirit that restless nervous energy that dominant individualism working for good and for evil and withal all that buoyancy and exuberance which comes with freedom and thereby acquired a common identity in short it was in the crucible of the frontier that the immigrants were americanized for more than a century turner's thesis has loomed over the history of the western united states like a battle-scarred colossus it has been repeatedly assaulted by professional historians for the way that it airbrushes the native american experience out of the records leaves unexamined the contributions of women and frontier communities like the germans and mormons and fails to explain why similar our experiences on other nineteenth century frontiers in siberia australia southern africa argentina and canada conspicuously failed to americanize those pioneers but how ever much it is battered turner's argument has refused to fall down if only because the opening up of the west did profoundly affect the rest of the country and did call forth a specifically american response in popular consciousness therefore turner's frontier has until now remained unchallenged the term continues to be automatically attached to such boundless areas as outer space the internet or intellectual property implying that here are fresh and unlimited opportunities particularly suited to exploitation by american enterprise and adaptability the spirit it engendered remains the default explanation for what makes america different from the rest of the world in the era of terrorism and mass immigration however a seismic shift is clearly taking place it is the older meaning of from tear that draws public attention the line that delineates an area of sovereignty,0
B009F1EPYW,looking back i suppose it's no real surprise that i ended up where i am in the music industry i mean both my parents came from a strong musical background my mum and burn was raised in churchtown a suburb on the south side of dublin in a large family of seven children three brothers and four sisters as and they were all musical my mum's mother passed away when i was little so i don't remember too much about her but i've always been reasonably close to my grandad tom who later remarried he still lives quite close to my mum in london and he's proper irish a real jack the lad who still loves a drink and a fag tom has got to be one of the happiest people you could ever meet and whenever i see him he always makes me laugh even now at ninety odd he has an eye for the ladies and they seemed to like him right back tom was a boy soprano back in the nineteen thirties and he'd encourage his four daughters to sing together in harmony from a very young age age while the boys played musical instruments and sang in fact two of my uncles brian and michael had a number one hit in ireland with their band emmet spice land and then brian went on to appear in musicals not jesus christ superstar and joseph by the time mum was about eighteen the family had moved from ireland to sheffield and finally to london mom and her sisters louise moira and paula formed a four piece vocal group called jeep and sang nineteen forties jazz and cover versions of hits by the andrew sisters like chattanooga choo-choo and boogie woogie bugle boy the band started small in pubs and clubs but after they appeared on a tv to a show called rising stars bedok egg started to come their way and they were soon supporting big names of the day like jimmy tapa les dennis and russ abbot in fact les dennis love my mum's judy garland impersonations so much that she was asked to join him on a tv show called go for it wished impressions of people like marilyn monroe oh dolly parton and mae west i grew up listening to my mom and her sisters singing those nineteen forty songs whenever they were together and i learned the moon myself to it's influence the way i sing to this day and there are certain jazzy tones in my voice that i most definitely got from singing along to those old tunes my dad play nato was musical too and it was a bit of a wild thing a handsome rocker with highlighted blonde hair a well toned body bright green eyes and olive skin he was born in egypt the son of a diplomat for the united nations and grew up in ethiopia in the congo until he was a teenager dad came from quite a wealthy greek family i had a brother byron and a sister maria when they eventually came to england they lived in a big house in west hampstead north london he went to private school and had the opportunity to go to university and have the best education money could buy but he just wasn't interested like my mum he loved music and he wanted to be around rock star and rebel so we took all the money his father gave him and built recording studio in dallas hill with his brother byron the first year or so of my life we all lived in my nan and grandad's luxurious hampstead home i was always called to litter by my great grandparents yes that's the correct pronunciation it means tiny tula because both my nan and i were named tula and she was big tula i always much preferred this nicknamed my full name to la paulina contest atlas which is why i changed it later on the greek side of my family had a big influence on me when i was young until i was about five when my nan and grandad moved back to greece build a house so a lot of them had strong beliefs and opinions and from a very young age i remember being lectured about how i should be and what i should think i suppose i'm a bit like my dad so as i got older i started to develop my own notions about how i wanted to be but when i was a little girl a lot of my influences were quite true additionally greek uncle byron and ansary also lived at my nan and granddad's house with their two boys my cousins sparrows and dino but eventually my dad and his brother both moved into council flats with their own families uncle byron an aunt so he ended up on a council estate in camden and we were lucky enough to get amazing it and bell sighs park right on the border of the pasha greener areas towards hampstead in the more urban areas of kentish town and camden as we live quite near each other the two families would spend a lot of time together and i became very close to my cousin dana in fact by the time i was five years old we were so close that we innocently made a pact to marry one another will make grew up not yet understanding that we were family and couldn't do that my mom would either take me to see dino every day or he would be round our place with his mom and his brothers spare us and like my dad and uncle byron dina and i became pretty much inseparable,1
1629977381,to include literature the arts and other aspects of the past i have also included a diverse range of women so we can look at judaism islam china vietnam japan india russia and more when the course is over you'll have learned a lot about the social political and intellectual hist three of the pre modern world you will also have learned about some of the women who made it happen i'm an historian so i work primarily with written texts this skews the evidence a bit when we are looking at women from the past because most but not all of the writers were men and for them to record the lives of women the women had to be unique sometimes uniquely powers will smart talented or vicious that means there were millions of anonymous women who lived their lives worked hard supported their families and died largely forgotten this course is not their story instead i'll tell the stories of the women who made it into the records those who were exceptional i'll begin this course with the founding of the roman empire in the west once the empire had been founded it dominated the mediterranean world for the next four hundred years and it established a rule by dynasties unlike the republic that preceded it once emperors or kings decide that their bloodline should rule women become centrally important and women who control new generations have opportunities to influence events sometimes for better and sometimes for worse this was true in the roman empire as well as in the empires that were being established in other parts of the world one of the themes we'll see throughout this course is that as rulers everywhere begin to establish empires that united and transcended tribal societies they began to impose new controls on women and on their sexual freedom one reason for such regulation was to guarantee t the ruling bloodlines but rulers also believed that controlled households created highly regulated societies for taxation laws and similar structures historians haven't reached a consensus on why empires controlled women we only know they do did as we will see some women struggled against this new order and the first to rebel was julia daughter of the first roman emperor therefore i'll begin this course with julia the elder the roman emperors daughter and the mother of julia the younger that woman who's in infant was exposed to die on the wind-swept island her story shows attention we will often see throughout this course she wanted personal sovereignty to control her own life while her father passed laws that restricted the choices of women and families she will help us understand the struggles of ancient women for the next centuries the first roman emperor caesar augustus had only one daughter julia as he tried to craft an empire centered on family ties he ran into trouble with her here's what happened in twenty seven bc he the roman empire was born octavian the adopt son and heir of julius caesar had defeated his opponents in a civil war and declared himself trinkets kiwi titus first citizen of rome in twenty seven bc he the senate granted him the title augustus meaning great or venerable and a new order was born augustus called it the principle but historians ever since have called it the roman empire now rome was administered by one man and for the next four hundred some years the roman empire ruled the mediterranean world and in turn was ruled by an emperor augustus invented the structure of the new empire as he went along and he ruled long enough forty one years that by the end few people could recall any other system augustus was a careful conservative man who organized society in ways that he believed were appropriate he believed rome would prosper if it returned to what he believed were family values of the republic he recalled or imagined a time when father is ruled households with modest quiet wives who spun wool at home and bored,0
B0759LX2S4,i made up excuses as to why i didn't have the time to go back to therapy i needed more time with my children i needed more time with my clients a break was good or so i tried to convince myself unable to identify the reluctance i felt in returning to e m d r i likened it to the difficulty people incur in returning to the gym after having been away for a while it was normal to struggle to regain momentum and with that justification i forced myself to stop thinking about it and to refrain from further introspection and after all i was doing fine i had everything under control and was beginning to think perhaps i didn't need to go back to e m d r therapy at all then i was sucker punched by my dad he and his wife had made plans to come and visit for a few days since our last visit went well i found myself actually excited about the prospect of having him here i told my kids and we were all excitedly making plans for where we would take them sites we would show them and what we would do together i had scattered myself off work so i could devote all of my attention on this earth rare family time two nights before he was due to arrive dan and i got into a fight because dan told me that he didn't want me to get so excited about my dad's visit he always let you down dan warned i just don't want to see you get crushed again our last visit was good i snipped and this one is going to be even better he's changing dan shook his head no stephanie he's not changing you changed but he's the same person you don't get it i chided i'm just trying to protect you from getting hurt he replied well don't i spat dan didn't say anything else and i stormed out of the kitchen and upstairs to get ready for bed i spent the next day getting the house ready for my day add in his wife i changed the guest room sheets cleaned the bathroom and baked home made cinnamon rolls which i knew my dad love then i made sure the kids rooms were presentable and the rest of the house was spotless while waiting for dan to come home from work,1

B01727MGPU,to see the b fifty twos i pressed myself against the barrier until bruises darkened my ribs thrilled to watch kate pearson drink from a water bottle only to have my best friend tell me that to her the concert wasn't about the band it was about us it was about the fact that we were there together that the music itself was secondary sorry to our world merely something that colored it spoke to it that's why those records from highschool sound so good it's not that the songs were better is that we were listening to them with our friends drunk for the first time on the cores touching sweaty palms staring for hours at a poster on the wall not grossed out by carpet or dirt or crumpled oily bedsheets these songs and album ys were the best ones because of how huge adolescence felt then and how nostalgia recasts it now nostalgia is so certain the sense of familiarity and instills makes us feel like we know ourselves like we've lived to get a sense that we have already journeyed through something survived it experienced it is often so much easier and less messy than the task of currently living through something though hard to grasp asp nostalgia is a leading to baskin temporarily restoring color to the past it creates a sense memory that momentarily simulates context nostalgia is recall without the criticism of the present day all the good parts memory without the pain finally nostalgia asked so little of us just to be noticed and revisited it doesn't require the difficult task of negotiation the heartache and uncertainty that the present does now i can't listen to some of these records alone in my house that i have cleaned and organized books arranged just so sheets washed the sounds don't hold up in these cases fandom is contextual and experiential it's not that it happened it's that you were there it's site specific age specify vick being a fan has to do with the surroundings and divorce the sounds from that context often feels distancing disorienting but mostly disappointing i think of all the times i've had a friend over and pulled out records from high school or college ready for the album to change someone's life the way it changed mine i watch my friends face waiting eagerly for the aha moment to arrive only to realize that my affection for this intentionally off-key singing saggy bay south sound and lyrics about bunnies isn't quite the revelation it was fifteen years ago you had to be there is not always a gloat or admonishment often it's an explanation for why something sounds utterly terrible yet there is much music that survives d and rican textural ization and that needs no experiential reference point in this case the role of the fan is to still be a participant and to participate is to grant yourself permission to immerse to willingly gladly a face and subsume yourself for the sake of the larger meaning yeah but also to provide meaning it's symbiotic my favorite kind of musical experience is to feel afterward that your heart is filled up and transformed like it is pumping a whole new kind of blood into your veins this is what it is to be a fan curious open desiring for connection to feel like art has chosen you claimed you as a witness i grew up in the suburbs of seattle mostly in redmond washington a once rural town that by the late twentieth century was a melanin for microsoft cities frequently deride or deny their outlying residents thinking them callow seattle as my beacon and muse but it was never really mine my parents both raised jewish and chicago were quick to adopt the religion of christmas though i should acknowledge the transitional years wherein we awoke to scattered presence under a menorah poor santa arriving during the night with nothing to choose from but that menorah and a houseplant then my mother left when i was fourteen seeking a cure for herself but leaving another form of sickness and longing behind it was a childhood of half waves of in-betweens until i was in high school every concert i attended was an event a spectacle my first was madonna she began her like a virgin tour in seattle playing three shows at the paramount theatre with a capacity of less than three thousand it was nineteen eighty five and i was in fifth grade and agree payment was made between my father and my friend's mom she'd get up at an unkind hour on a saturday morning so that we could wait in line at ticketmaster and my dad would stay out past his bedtime and accompany us to the,1
B01H0G6TOM,what do you do when you cannot leave and cannot return back in october twenty eleven i had considered never returning to libya i was in new york walking up broadway they are cold and swift when the proposition presented itself it seemed immaculate a thought my mind had manufactured independently as in youthful moment nts of drunkenness i felt bold and invincible i had gone to new york the previous month at the invitation of barnard college to lecture novels about exile and estrangement but i had an older connection to the city my parents had moved to manhattan in the spring of nineteen seventy when my father was appointed first secretary to the libyan mission to the united nations i was born that autumn three years later nineteen seventy three we returned to tripoli the year since i had visited new york maybe four or five times and always briefly so although i had just returned to the city of my birth it was a place i hardly knew in the thirty six years since we left libya my family and i had built associations with several surrogate cities nairobi where we went on our escape from libya nineteen seventy nine and have continued to visit ever since cairo where we settled into indefinite exile the the following year rome a vacation spot for us london where i went at the age of fifteen for my studies and where for twenty nine years i have been doggedly trying to make a life for myself paris were fatigued and annoyed by london and moved in my early thirties vowing never to return to england only to find myself back two years later in all these cities i had pictured myself one day calm and living in that faraway island manhattan where i was born i would imagine a new acquaintance asking me perhaps at a dinner party or in a cafe or in changing rooms after a long swim that old tiresome question where are you from and i unphased and free of the usual agitation would casually reply new york in these fantasies i saw myself taking pleasure from the fact that such a statement would be both true and false like a magic trick that i should move to manhattan in my fortieth year as libya was ripping itself apart and for this to take place on the first of september the day when back in nineteen sixty nine a young captain named muammar gaddafi deposed king idris and many of the significant features of my life where i live the language in which i write the language i'm using now to write this were set in motion all this made it difficult to escape the idea that there was some kind of divine will at work in any political history of libya the nineteen eighties represent a particularly lurid chapter opponents of the regime were hanged in public squares and sports arenas dissidents who fled the country were pursued some kidnapped or assassinated the eighties were also the first time that libya had an armed and determined resistance to the dictatorship my father was one of the opposition's most prominent figures the organization he belonged to had a training camp and charred south of the libyan border and several underground cells inside the country father's career in the army his short tenure as a diplomat and the private means he had managed to procure in the mid nineteen seventies when he became a successful businessman importing products as diverse as mitsubishi vehicles and converse sports shoes to the middle east made him a dangerous enemy me the dictatorship had tried to buy him off it had tried to scare him i remember sitting beside him one afternoon in our flat in cairo when i was ten or eleven the weight of his arm on my shoulders and the chair opposite sat one of the men i called uncle men who i somehow knew were his allies or followers the word compromise was spoken and father responded i want negotiate not with criminals whenever we were in europe he carried a gun before getting into the car he would ask us to stand well away,1
B0751LJHC9,it has to be sacrificed lou was in a good mood and if the interview went well he might be willing to stay for dinner we continued to enjoy the food and finally i stood up and said we should probably go do our talk he looked as if he had completely forgotten about it but he stood up and followed me downstairs and into the front room when we emerged i could feel the audiences tense energy lieu of course seemed impervious that kind of tension was the emotional see he swam in the air he breathed the room was small and it was packed a number of people had traveled great distances to be there everyone had known that liu was in the house but his not emerging for the reception length the gathering an edge this was lou reed after all maybe he would walk out when we sat down in the two chairs set up in the front of the room we adjusted our mics and i thanked reed for coming anything for you he said our car conversation rambled on for an hour we talked about writing andy warhol delmore schwartz the velvet underground and laurie anderson we took questions from the audience and then we were done now lou was in a great mood he remained in his seat as people came by to say hello and brought me memorabilia for him to sign he was gracious to everyone and looked over the rarities presented to him mentioning that even he didn't have copies of some of them then after about fifteen minutes he joined us for dinner everyone got their lou reed story and i got my compliment i'd gotten to know lou from writing about him in rolling stone and elsewhere and over the course of more than fifteen years we'd regularly run into each other in new york at clubs and concerts at restaurants and parties i always felt that one of the reasons lou and i got along well was that we met socially before we ever met as artist and critic in june of nineteen ninety five i got stuck at the airport in cleveland where i had gone to cover the concert celebrating the opening of the rock and roll hall of fame backed by soul asylum lou had turned into a roaring version of sweet jane as part of that show my flight back to new york was delayed for hours and i was settling in for the wait when i ran into a record company friend who introduced me to lou and laurie there is nothing like an interminable flight delay to grease the gears of socialization you reviewed new york for rolling stone right reid asked referring to his classic nineteen eighty nine album right how many stars did you give it for should have been five he said but he was smiling the ice had been broken so we sat and chatted in the airport lounge the subject of the hall of fame's list of the five hundred songs that shaped rock and roll came up and lew asked if walk on the wild side was on it it was and he seemed pleased to be represented then in a sweet gesture he asked if lori's oh superman had been included it had not but at that moment i got a sense of how important she was to him he didn't want to make the moment all about him though i subsequently interviewed liu a half dozen times or so i remember those more casual moments with the most affection i recall talking with him at length about brian wilson whom he greatly admired at a party for amnesty intern national another time i ran into him outside trattoria dell'arte on seventh avenue when he and laurie were heading to carnegie hall to see the cuban musicians who had been part of the buena vista social club phenomenon it was a warm summer night and liu was wearing a light colored short sleeve shirt he was in his late fifties at the time and his hair was graying in the fading sunlight i could see the lines of aging on his face and neck rather than the daunting leather clad figure of lou reed he looked like the man he had in a sense become an aging jewish new yorker out for a night of entertainment with his already attractive girlfriend he also seemed to be in a terrific mood he was excited to see the show and asked if i was going when i explained that i didn't have tickets he half jokingly asked you think laurie and i could get you in as some kind of he hesitated in order to come up with the exact right phrase celebrity perk we all laughed but i was touched nonetheless encountering him around the city that way always made me proud to be a new york native an artist of incalculable significance lou was also as one of his song titles put it the ultimate n y c man as inextricable a part of the city as say the twa in towers now he and they are gone and the city still stands however much diminished,1

B06VTJNXN2,welcome to family law audio learn the course outline in this outline will review the following family marriage the government and the constitution requirements rules and regulations of marriage marital agreements the marital breakdown grounds and defenses marital breakdown finance real issues children's issues termination and adoption they say in life there are only two certainties death and taxes as an attorney these are two ripe fields to practice in but i think another sure thing and often more rewarding field is family law in this outline we will cover the following topics throat ing in some case law and real life examples to help you tackled the bar exam we will go over things like what is a family and what is a marriage even though i know that sounds pretty straightforward the document called the constitution is pervasive yep even in family law and we will go over how much of a role it plays as and families we will also go over main takeaways and notes for the bar exam as well as quizzes to refresh the material we just went over in each section section two will cover the requirements rules and regulations of marriage that is what kansas states require and what do states require when is a marriage valid or not and common law marriages we will hit premarital and marital agreements which leads us nicely into divorce we will discuss grounds for divorce defenses of these grounds and where someone is able to get divorced aka jurisdiction we will talk about the issues in a divorce such as marital support spousal supt forked and the characterization and division of property as well as child custody we will also hit on termination of parental rights and adoption to close it out i feel confident that after listening to this outline you will feel much more confident about some of the family law terms and theories for the bar exam section one family marriage the government and the constitution this section will cover what a family is what a marriage is and how the constitution affects it a what does the family first you need to understand what a family is and how the constitution protects families it sounds crazy and really obvious but it's actually been litigated a lot first up in one case called the city of la du vs horn the issue was a zoning ordinance which defined a family as one or more people related by blood marriage or adoption occupying a dwelling unit as an individual housekeeping organization the plaintiffs in ladoo were not married but did some things that a married couple would do like share a bedroom and have a joint checking account despite these behaviors the court determined there was no fundamental right to live with someone you're not related to sorry shocker uppers so strict scrutiny did not apply the state needs to have only a rational basis to enact legislation bearing on the definition of family so the end result the state can create zoning classifications even on the basis of morality requiring marriage for a family to exist another case brushy versus stall associates and company look more to the function of the family unit rather than just the form like the law du court in brushy the court looked to the realities of family life in a same sex couple rather than whether they were married the court held that in order for a family relationship to exist there has to be one a commitment to a permanent relationship and to an apparent reciprocal obligation to support each other some of this can be parties or in a relationship for health benefits visitation for children or even tax benefits these cases give you an idea of just how squishy family law can be sometimes the court has to look at a variety of factors and even sometimes argue over what a family is before can even begin to apply the law exam notes courts tend to look at either the function or form of a family to determine first what a family is and second whether legislation affecting families is constitutional in many jurists actions relationships can be based on a contract informal or formal and courts can apply a rule of equity when it comes to property or financial support when the relationship ends question to when would someone have rights to property in a non miracle relationship the answer if there is the existence of a contract majority view that will be some equitable remedies if appropriate number three what is the state's relationship in the marriage the answer party to a civil contract between two individuals,0
B00HCKX6KC,albright of this mongol victory furthermore the city was largely burned and with that went as so many of the monuments of the palaces the mosques that had been really the model for islamic architecture since the eighth century a day of the only population to be spared was a small group of chris kitchens known as nestorian christians and that's because reputedly one of the wives of the a mongol khan was a christian herself it is hard to calculate the losses a cultural inhuman at baghdad reports run as many as eight hundred thousand people were in the city clearly the city was one of the great urban populations of the world at the time someone put those numbers as high as one million it was swollen with many refugees from the countryside at the start of the siege in addition the losses the intellectual than religious the art losses are an enormous baghdad had been an intellectual center for centuries it is where the quran was edited in it's final version where the great debates that taken place among islamic theologians was the koran the uncreated word of god spoken directly through muhammad in arabic or was it to be taken allegorically it is where persian and arabic scholars had drawn on the knowledge of greek antiquity of hindu india and of a persian i iran and and and gained great achievements in mathematics they created algebra in medicine are in geography and history all of this legacy went up in flames in that destruction on that fateful day and the forty days that followed the image is riveting and it's still indoors in the islamic world is one of the great catastrophes are in fact many a muslim might say that the mongols are represented a great catastrophe their worst nightmare of barbarians they typified the clash of barbarian peoples of the steppes and the civilized peoples of civilization such as europe the islamic world in idiot and china but is this image true is this the only image are the mongols just ruthless conquerors and so were the previous people of the steppes was their role to be either defeated or better yet civilized and incorporated and assimilated well what we're going to look at is not only this image but perhaps other images that are equally telling of the relationship between nomadic peoples and the sedentary civilizations in this course i propose to look at all of these images why they spring to us why they have come down through the historical record and why the people of the steppes have come to play such an important role ever since the first people known as p i e proto indo european speakers first domesticated the horse and made possible movement of peoples over the grasslands of eurasia of people who are hearty capable of living on that climate and wresting a living from demanding conditions of following the seasons in their herds ever searching for pastures in water and constantly exchanging whatever goods they had for food and luxuries from the urban literate civilizations this course is a daunting challenge and it has been put together researched and offered in response to customers of the great courses as well as my own students and these questions are rising largely because of a fascination not only in the steps but two of the great conquerors too the men that epitomize that image of the sack of baghdad one of them is the granddad of who lago who sacked baghdad and that is genghis khan a household word and the other is attila the hun both of these conquerors are seen as the worst nightmare of civilized populations they are great conquerors we conjure up the images of the horse archers the great cavalry armies that swept over the steppes and the image has been enduring it fascinates repels it has attracted many many people to question how to these conquerors come about and where do they fit in the larger scope of history i can say on a very unscientific method of polling my students over a number of years that among the two conquerors genghis khan whose real name was tema genus he gets the name genghis khan universal lord and twelve o six a great name of genghis khan scores two to one over attila the hun who has perhaps a better name scourge of god among students and an various acquaintances of mine in terms of barbarian recognition that is genghis khan is seen as a greater and more,0

B0767W5991,i had a wonderful father who loved to dance he would let me stand barefoot on the top of his shoes so we could dance to the tunes on the radio he died two years after my husband and i was able to tell him that but for his love i do not believe i could have survived the difficulty of becoming a young widow his memory still sustains me today my parents were of eastern european descent and they both came independently from toronto to detroit they were the poster couple for opposites attracting my father was loving kind and non-judgmental by contrast my mother was brutally honest almost to a fault as the oldest of ten children my mother had to quit school to help raise her siblings she went to work in a sewing factory when she was fourteen years old thus mother became a skilled perfectionist in every task imaginable in a household with the exception of giving and receiving in love and affection in photographs of me with my mother when i was a child she rarely had an affectionate arm around me in contrast i have my arms wrapped around her as if i am an accessory hanging on for dear life mother always had delicious food for guests to munch on when they came for a visit i suspect they all overlooked my mother's lack of any sense of humor because my father was so easy going and fun to be around my dad would pitch baseball at the local school on saturdays a lot of the boys loved to play or watch the games and they all called my dad pinky at break time dad would buy all the kids a soda pop my dad was a sucker for kids and loved being around them my childhood dream was to run a home for orphaned children i just wanted to take care of them i am sure i learned this love for children from reading little orphan annie in my later years when i began to date my suitors would all look forward to visiting with my dad he was their local hero mother was president of sa seven jewish organizations that helped the homeless hungry or people in need of medication although i was not the beneficiary of her selfless efforts my mother's commitment to helping others made a huge and lasting impression on me,1
B01M0N5RBS,tales of my cricketing youth he was suitably indifferent plus he was struggling to carry all his drinks the banana the stumps and the small wardrobe over to the nets i on the other hand was strolling over twirling my cherished bat in my hand like a dandy at twenty first century sporting equivalent from oscar wilde the club was obviously concerned about people burgling the nets or maybe setting up a tent and squatting there so before we could do anything we had to negotiate the padlock once my companion had entered the code we were nearly ready to go we picked a net and i wanted dan astroturf to put up the stumps at the far end it is always important when covering cricket to mention the surface of the wicket especially when you're going to use it as an excuse later on the stumps were spring loaded and all attached to one metal plate as i sat them down i looked back up the strip to see my playing partner going through a stretching routine and moving his left arm round and round in a circular motion is taking this seriously i thought it might not be saying this is just a friendly knock about in the nets what did you want to do first battle bowl given he'd been doing a possible impression of a windmill for the past few minutes i already knew the answer but i thought it polite to give him the option thou bullet you can the less than surprising reply i picked up my back turned on my heels and headed back towards the stumps do you want to stick a pad on he asked if you're unfamiliar with cricket let me just explain the role of the pads given that a cricket ball is a very hard and be can be held in about smith's direction at some speed there are various bits of equipment available to them batsmen for his protection a helmet for the head a box for the delicate areas and pads for the shins and the knees when having a gentle net a batsman might choose to forego some or all of the equipment and at the level we were playing at that morning there was certainly no need for a helmet or a box the most them i'd be required will be one pad to protect my front leg i the one that will be nearest the ball being a typical man i decided i would be fine without i wasn't going to get hurt here i really wasn't i was going to channel my inner atherton that had to be good enough even as i watch my opponent measure out his run up i didn't think about protection he marked out ten steps i'll be fine eleven steps he isn't quick enough yet to hurt me twelve steps i haven't got time to go and get a pad now thirteen steps right remember channel atherton channel atherton fourteen stat if in doubt just jump out of the way he stopped off and christ for that he turned ready he shouted he had to share because he appeared now to be a very very long way away a cricket pitch is twenty two yards long and he must have been that plus another fifteen yards away from me ready i replied while thinking i am going to show him just what it takes to get to my level but just as pride comes before a fall middle aged bravado often comes before both mental and physical pain he began his run up i gripped and i gripped hard that trusty old gray nicolls the greatest talents have soft hands mine was so tense the veins were bulging one hadn't worn batting gloves either i lifted the bat abundant into the astroturf next to my back foot i lifted it once more as he got closer my eyes focused on his run up i was waiting to see the left hand gripping the ball if you look at the grip as a boulder is about to bowl you can hopefully understand what he's going to try to do with the delivery i saw the grip i saw him begin the jump as he got ready to release the ball i saw his right arm come out to try and give him some kind of accuracy i saw the left arm get higher and higher i saw him release the ball then i didn't see the ball i push forward to where i expected the ball to be in or atherton if in doubt a nice forward defensive will do but i was too late the ball had already careered off the pitch gray's money and clattered into my stumps if there was plenty wrong with my eyesight at that moment there was nothing wrong with my hearing as i clearly picked up the noise of a wicket reverberating on a coiled spring mixed in with the cheering of the bola my head was down i couldn't look up i didn't want to acknowledge that delivery give credit to the bowler or even look him in the eye,1
B07C2YGH7W,women listen up we have the power as women to run the world this isn't hypothetical it's not wishful thinking we already have the ability to do it as women we have unique advantages that make us ideally suited to lead and to lead more effectively than men despite decades of superficial change in the ranks of business today's women are stalled in their quest to advance their careers across every level of work in every industry women still struggle to earn the same level of pay to receive equal access to opportunity and promotion and to do the work they were hired to do without fear of harassment or the discrimination of pervasive gender bias men meanwhile act in countless ways that perpetuate these very biases secure in the belief that this is the natural order of things men still think they run the world and still think they dictate the rules not any more we have the power to change this this right now i'm going to rock the boat how capsize the boat by showing you how we can harness our natural talents as women to dominate in business not by leaning in or out manning the man or beating me and at their own game but by capitalizing on the very things that make us different women need to jettison the societal norms perpetuated by male domination and use an entirely different playbook one written by a woman for women you are holding that playbook i have succeeded for decades in a cutthroat male dominated profession specifically by using my skills as a woman i'm here now to guide you on your own quest for success your journey will be much easier not to mention more fun knowing how to avoid the pitfalls roadblocks and dead ends it's possible you think none of this applies to you but before you make that judgment do me and yourself a favor and answer these questions honestly do you feel like men call the shots at your company deal compete according to the rules of a male playbook do you feel like you're stuck in your job with no clear path for advancement are you so tired of being stalled in a mid level job that you are thinking of just quitting does it feel like your colleagues or your boss are trying to push you out would you like an effective way of moving forward do men routinely underestimate you do you underestimate yourself do men make sexist comments engage in male bonding rituals and feel no shame in showing you unwanted attention would you like to know how to eliminate that behavior,1
B073VRS33N,in the far reaching consequences driven powerfully by the undertow of technology combined with demographic shifts these shifts are just beginning to gain momentum and will continue to impact all businesses everywhere one major shift in recent years is that leaders are currently dealing with a very different group of people entering the workplace the boomer generation of the post war years over seventy seven million workers in the united states alone largely motivated by hard work loyalty financial gain and job job security are retiring and leaving the workforce at a rate of ten thousand per day for a time generation x had moved into the workforce with a fairly low impact assimilating into the boomer workplace but now everything is changing a new workforce is emerging generation y and they are massive already outnumbering gen x in the workplace and working their way to becoming seventy five percent of the workforce by twenty twenty five most important they are a whole new story today's corporate leaders simply don't understand how to lead them them and how to motivate them and that is a problem creating a compelling vision and engaging teams to deliver the vision have always been key aspects of effective leadership that have been documented in almost every business book for the past thirty years or more the issue now is that lie readers are finding that what motivated previous generations doesn't compel gen y in fact this extremely creative and talented bunch are either never entering the workforce or are leaving in droves and leaders are scrambling to figure out how to stop the exodus where are they going your first thought may be that they are going to their parents' basement that may be true but don't judge them yet they may be creating the next facebook or air bnb from that basement but corporations need their talent to and for leaders to engage today's and tomorrow's workforce they will need to create an environment in which gen y will choose to participate the recession of two thousand and eight and the years following caused leaders everywhere to focus on urgent financial needs often at the cost of focusing on the important shifts caused by technology and demographics the major storm diverted their attention from the changing tide and as a result men any leaders in the business world have now been caught unprepared before you decide whether or not your organization's leadership bench is sufficient take a moment to assess your current senior leadership team to determine whether you have capable successors for all mission critical positions it is of course imp portant to use the right criteria such as what skills and experience successors will need to have in order to be effective leading your organization into the future potential successors must either possess or have the potential to gain the business and leadership skills required each organization has it's business criteria but leading with vision is a top of the house need for all without a mind review each mission critical position for the necessary skills including this attribute on your organizational chart one by one with each job title in the appropriate box if you have somebody who is ready now to take the role make that box green if you have someone who will be ready in the next two or three years make that both ks yellow if you do not have any one in the pipeline who seems to be capable of filling that role make that box read this should paint a picture of whether or not your organization is prepared for the demographic shift that is a large contributor to the current leadership challenge and which we will discuss throughout the book employees and leaders are floundering battered by waves of change and uncertainty with no rule book to guide them the more we research the issue of how to create a compelling vision that would actually capture generation y the more we realize that leaders need to make a crucial will shift they need to connect with their employees on an emotional rather than a cognitive level we wanted to understand the issues ourselves so in addition to our own research and experience we set out to learn from many top leaders and drew on the most significant work in the field it's been a great learning experience for us and we hope that in the following pages you will,0
B00UUHZH1U,this was officially the crappy a day of alexa conroy's life is there anything else i can do for you harvey walton her real estate agent asked he'd called to make sure she was happy with how the sale of her home had gone and she'd yet to do little more than answer in short sentences she'd sold her dream house for a very good price in a depressed market how could she complain the discount store violet harvey had sent didn't exactly thrilled her but she couldn't fault the gesture nope it was the obvious red and white sticker of her nemesis value hardware on the bottom of the pot she folded not harvey the only good thing about her new apartment was that she wouldn't have to see her nemesis down the block unless she pressed her forehead against the window and since said window had enough grime to reduce the outward view significantly she wasn't going to touch the thing especially with her face no thanks she said setting the violet on the windowsill judging from it's wilted state he would probably be dead in a couple days out of curiosity why did you choose to buy the violet from value hardware i assure you no one on their staff knows flowers like i do at harvey silence she gusted out a sigh she didn't need to take out her frustration on him it wasn't his fault that if she saw one more values signature smiley face balloons around town she'd probably go postal or was it floral since she operated a floral shop i'm sorry harvey she said pressing her fingertips against her forehead god she needed a massage not in the budget buttercup i appreciate all your help you made the whole process as painless as painless as it could be to sell the house she'd hoped to live in for the rest of her life but she'd done it for the right reasons and that made all the difference no doom and gloom here so i should received the check by next week by the end of next week jeff definitely her brain bling doubt on his talk of administrative procedures as she noticed the large spider building a tapestry screw calling it a web this thing was big enough to occupy a wall of a museum in the closet where she'd planned on putting her clothes her designer wardrobe just it happened to be the last shred of her free wheeling party girl lifestyle she didn't even get to have the sex that went with it anymore since she didn't voluntarily taken up celibacy as a participant sport despite her general malays lately she wasn't going to balk about killing one of god's creatures out of misplaced sympathy there was a line that couldn't be crossed by man or nature infringing on her woefully inadequate closet space was it alexa harvey asked are you still there yeah sorry i have a situation to attend to but thanks again and i'll be sure to call the next time i have a realist state she broke off no the only real estate she had left was her shop that was rented she had no intention of looking for new retail space so she would have no use for harvey ever take care of harvey she said with her brightest smile as she clicked off time to do some bug excavate asian she sidestepped her marmalade cat trixie who seemed intent on tripping her and seized her damp sponge and bucket the whole apartment needed a thorough scour before she settled in if she even could she certainly didn't have many comforts of home yet her flat screen tv a long leather couch tiffany style floor lamp and two end tables plus her queen size air mattress and the battered kitchen table left from the previous tenants filled most of the space oh and she couldn't forget the contents of her bedroom she winced at the curtain of purple beads she'd jerry rigged a section of the alcove that contained her air mattress all she needed was a lava lamp and a black light and she'd be in her own sixties nightmare,0
B06WVYNKP6,he is our cousin cousin my mother joan barlow died in two thousand and seven at the age of ninety three and so i became the custodian of most of the family archives these had always intrigued me as a child the old family bible of sixteen sixteen family trees or old letter as dating back some hundreds of years plus first hand accounts by for instance my great grandfather frederick good old cache of historical events such as queen victoria's coronation and wellington's funeral or my grandmother mable cash describing a visit to the house of commons in eighteen eighty nine above all the striking painting of my great great grandmother elizabeth pitiful lucas which was hung prominently in our has and is now in mine and caused me to wonder so often about her life ah branch of the barlow family it comes from a long line of quakers dating from the very beginnings of the society of friends we quakers have been fairly assiduous in maintaining our family records making it somewhat easier for the present day genealogist to trace their families right back to that early time also up until the late nineteenth century quakers only married within the faith and hence any of our family trees will form an intricate network of interlocking families so that for instance when i was at the quaker school leighton park in the nineteen fifties many of my peers were my close or distant cousins including such well known quaker names as cadbury's darby's fries round trees braithwaite highlands rock banks taylor's and nicholson's because of this interconnectedness of many quaker families it became customary for families to address each other by the title of cousin though they might only be second or even third cousins indeed when i was a child i remember my father's redoubtable mother referring to members of her extended family always by the prefix of cousin not as we might today talk of my cousins son so but almost as a title on it's own endowed with honour on it's bearer this custom so much an integral part of quaker life of bygone days gave me the idea of using a favorite quotation of my father ralph barlow from shakespeare's richard the second as a title for this book the intricate relationships of the houses of lancaster and york are so much a part of shakespeare's his replays that a full appreciation of the various dramas that make up the cycle are perhaps only fully understood by some knowledge of who's related to whom at the beginning of richard the second after king richard has banished his cousin henry bolingbroke following an argument he questions another cousin omo as to how bolingbroke had seemed when he left him despite his description of bolingbroke friends tearful farewell to their hero oma replies that he himself was unmoved and thought that his banishment should have been longer the king ironically reprimanding him says but he is our cousin cousin so this book tells the story of many of my cousins from the last three hundred and fifty years this book therefore is not only a personal family history but also very much the history of the society since most of my ancestors have at one time or another been caught up in the great issues that have engaged the society since it's inception from persecution and pacifism to temperance and anti-slavery one or other of my family have been leading champions along the way we also come across sailors and silk merchants wool merchants and cheese merchants pioneering businessmen and distinguished academicians and all of them devout quakers it is a fascinating history and one of which i am very proud,1

B07CX4FBDX,the linkedin profile basics the little things make big things happen john wasn't the one thing you'll have on linkedin like it or not as a profile sign up for linkedin and it's there you don't have to lift a finger if you're absolutely anti finger lifting your profile will be empty of everything but your name let's take two things for granted though you want to create a professional profile and you want that profile to do as much for you as it can if that sounds like the job you'd like your resume to do you're right your profile substitutes for a resume until the internet distant past of two thousand and twelve you could simply upload your resume for all the world to see and linkedin gave you tools that made the process easy as profiles became more feature filled and more detailed resumes became redundant at least in the sense that they were worth maintaining as a feature unto themselves as you'll see the difference between profiles and resumes especially for job seekers is really one of terminology and many of the rules that apply to resumes apply with equal force to profiles who are they will focus on the many ways that linkedin can establish and enhance your professional identity and on creating and nurturing connections through the site but linkedin also provides learning opportunities in different spheres to have those opportunities stand out first there's linked then as a research source for company information earlier we discussed interview preparation at length and as part of that we touched on company linkedin pages as a source of information in general employees linkedin pages can give you a picture of an employer that is more complete and more revealing than the picture review held by the company's own website or it's own linkedin page employ pages are always worth checking their most valuable when they're the pages of the people in the position or group you're interested in places where you're likely to find something of an insider's view of the company's current focus the best value comes however if you've scheduled an interview and you know your interviewer's names check them out on linkedin without fail you may find clues to the kind of keywords that will resonate in an interview along with information about projects they are involved in with that bit of linkedin stalking you can emphasize your own experience with similar work second there's linkedin as a measuring stick for career changers if you're looking at a new field you may not know exactly what you need to do or what your next step should be you can find though by seeing what those who have gone before you have done if you look at the profiles of twenty project managers and eighty eighteen of them hold pmp certifications you'll have a compelling indication of what matters in the field tying qualifications to actual people who are working in the real world is a lot more compelling than reading about theoretical qualifications in the abstract take a look at people's backgrounds outed they get where they are today again that's the real world telling you what the career path is like where to begin your headline it all starts with the headline that's the first thing that linkedin search engine will index which means that it's the key to making sure that you can be found left to it's own devices linkedin will use your current job title but the only limit to what you can do with your profile is length you have one hundred twenty characters in which to deliver a compelling message and far too many people settle for linkedin's default think of the headline as a way to establish your brand who are you what do you do what have you done and most important what will you do for an employer who wants to hire you keep it clear simple and direct it's a hook that's meant to grab the reader's interest,0

B003DN26KI,tests that performance reviews were supposed to do but never will ensuring a hierarchical control holding people accountable for their actions and their results giving employees the feedback and evaluations they need to improve their skills and giving the company more of what it requires i intend to hold a mirror up to managers forcing them to see how they use performance reviews to the detriment of both the employees and their companies and ultimately themselves by stunting their own growth as human beings i will show managers that while the alleged purpose of performance reviews is to enlightened subordinates about what they should be doing better the real purpose is intimidation aimed at preserving the boss's authority and domination in relationships such intel foundation is unnecessary of course the boss has the power with or without the performance review but most managers don't really have a clue about what holding somebody accountable means they think the only way to deal with mistakes is to mete out punishments no wonder people in the ranks are so defensive why would any rational person want to own up to their mistakes and admit to needing further development when the costs for doing so include deficient ratings to me the problem boils down to why one word insecurity although incompetence comes in a close second too many managers relish the authority they have and fear losing it they worry they won't be able to persuade their direct reports to do things their way so they get their self confidence the only way they know by intimidating their subordinates into silent compliance in other words they scare the hell out of them that's true even with the so called popular managers the ones who smile joke and try to me make everybody like them at some level they know that subordinates who want good ratings will overlook all the crap they hand down the insensitive comments the useless just in case we needed assignments and the all nighters to produce a report that was delayed because of the manager had failed to read the first draft in time fearing the consequences subordinates absorb insults and slights that outside of the office would never be tolerated they remained silent when managers speak authoritatively on topics where the employee has more expert t's experience common sense and basic knowledge they grin and bear it when managers use the imperial we as if what is being said is fact not personal belief or opinion the looming performance review protects the manager from dealing with how subordinates really feel it's like an anesthetic the unhappiness and anger is still there but the manager doesn't have to feel a thing mkii them sadly most managers are oblivious to the havoc they wreck with performance reviews to some extent they don't know any better this is how perform elements reviews have been done and this is how they will be done period those who can't get promoted but let's face it few managers get their jobs because of their keen understanding of people or their ability to bring people together when there are misunderstandings and differences most managers have never been taught how to be good managers is almost as if they learned to be managers the same way way they learned how to do performance reviews by filling in the blanks instead of being guided by an understanding of human nature treating the people who work for them as unique human beings they base their actions on self serving logic and clumsy attempts at control they fail to realize the most essential tool they have in getting quality performances is a trusting relationship with the people who work for them it's really that simple if they understood this there never would be something as stupidly one sided as a performance review defined by domination by the boss here's a simple experiment you can try ask yourself,0
B005T5M5YA,and in constant dialogue with it earth this is a book about land tour at least about the meeting of land and paper there is nothing mysterious or mystical about this for most of english history land was the principal means of production land was the national industry even as late as seventeen thirty three quarters the population derived their livelihood from it and half was directly engaged in farming by eighteen hundred that proportion had dropped to a third by eighteen fifty to a fifth by nineteen hundred and tenth by nineteen seventy of fortieth and by two thousand one hundred our distance from the realities of land is the biggest obstacle we have in empathizing with the past we no longer have an intuitive understanding of the centrality of the cultivated earth that the life systems of england land not only as a way of growing food but for the gentry a source of income in the form of rent or the sale of produce grown and sold and as a supremely secure acid safer than houses for the seventeenth century political theorist james harrington the foundation of property be in land but if in money lightly come lightly go land was also more than money on the frontispiece of the english gentlewoman richard brathwaite sixteen thirty one etiquette book for ladies is ideal pupil is depicted with the motto floating beside her saying grace my guide glory my goal but in the english gentleman published the year before he his touchstones are pests in terrace space in kayla's feet on the lands hope in the heavens land was the foundation for this life and in some ways a foreshadowing of the life to come it was the realm through which landowners could extend their presence into a seductive display a theater in which they could perform a playground on which they could take their exercise and a visible tangible and moldable anchor in the world of men much of this book describes the hyphenated reality of a family in a place precision organized land which over generations if you were lucky was owned loved used made remade and if need be defended against others gentry priorities for order settlement and continuity for visible well being and a hierarchy of community of which there were the local summit could all be read in the landscape in the fields systems manor houses gardens orchards churches and villages of rural england these settlements were not arranged on purely ergonomic or financial grounds they were self portraits of the families that own them gentry landscape was autobiography in earth england is covered with these deeply symbolic gentry places and they formed the counterpart to the privacy of the manuscripts landscape was the gentry face archives the gentry heart many houses do survive often with the parish church is next to them with the gentry tombs in their own chapels at the east end often beautiful and highly articulate memorials to have forgotten ideology but gentry existence was less well funded and more vulnerable to change and failure than that of the great aristocrats and so their houses and the surrounding skirts of landscape do not always survive intact i have walked the lands of all the families in this book and it is a poignant pleasure to beat your way through an overgrown wood or to walk across the stubble of a just harvested wheat field to find nothing but a soggy hollow or a single ivy bearded wall while knowing in the most in intimate detail from their papers the events that occurred there three four or five centuries before oh destinies unfolded where now there are only a few crabbed trees or the lingering after smell of fox reality is intimate and rather than attempt to heroic an olympian survey of the whole gentry world i have taken a sequence of twelve individual gentry families each at a particular crisis in their lives i have chosen them only if they were richly articulate about themselves and if their archives have somehow survived although there are oceans of ordinariness here each family is not quite ordinary each,0
B00EDQSE4Q,you'd have thought that in nineteen forty five would have had more important things on his mind than trying to kill me i was spending most of my time in a cot which wasn't too surprising given that i was only a few weeks old so i wasn't really in a position to alter the course of the war anyway still all the furor was never one for letting little details like that get in his way and with germany losing the war at a great rate of knots in desperation he threw his last roll of the dice the v two bombs over three thousand of them the first manmade objects to be launched into space and the direct forerunner of today's space rockets were launched against the allies and london was one of the prime targets for the germans an estimated seven thousand people died as these killers haphazardly exploded in britain and the continent and there could easily have been one more me had i lived a few doors away just down the road from our small house a silent but deadly v two exploded that early spring day causing devastation and loss of life all around but leaving me unscathed in spite of the shattered glass and debra that sprayed over me and my cot once all the commotion had died down i was ready to get back to my baby sleep perhaps just perhaps it was the first sign that lady luck was going to smile on me in a way that defies logic even all these years later it was the first time that i was to triumph one over tragedy but it certainly wasn't going to be the last in a fanciful way it could also have been the germans way of getting back at the johnston family as my father had seen action against them in the first world war after joining up even though he was under age he served in the royal horse artillery three as a leading rider pulling cannons into battle by six horses yes it was that long ago and was one of the few who survived all the conflict from nineteen fourteen to nineteen eighteen during the course of the war he even picked up four medals for bravery and service and he must have deserved them all given that part of the carnage he survived was the battle of the somme one million other soldiers didn't on the first day alone almost twenty thousand british troops died the worst day in our military history but dad got out in one piece perhaps that was why the v two fell near me maybe hitler was trying to get his revenge by wiping our neighborhood edmonton north london and off them up that is the only reason i can think of either that or the rocket got lost on it's way to a more prestigious destination than the area where i was born and bred i'm not knocking edmonton far from it but let's be honest it's hardly the most salubrious as part of town in the ninth century the vikings had managed to sail up the river lee which runs through the area but not too many people followed in their footsteps in the years to come as shortly afterwards the encroaching marshland made it hard for any big boats to get through even the new river that runs through it isn't all that new it dates back to tudor times and it's not even a river just a channel cut from the river lea in an attempt to bring fresh drinking water into poor old london town all a four hundred years ago nowadays edmondson is pro kimberly best known as a turning off the busy a four o six the north circular road and for it's massive ikea showroom famous for it's opening night chaos when six thousand people rioted and one man was stabbed in the fight for the so called bargains it certainly wasn't as they they say like that in my day rites were few and far between back then probably the most famous of all edmondson sons is bruce forsyth the game show host and one of the few people who can genuinely be called a showbiz legend bruce whose family were garage owning salvo asian army members went to almost famous local school the latimer school and was already busy working as a fifteen year old with a song dance and accordion act called boy bruce and mighty atom when i entered the world on the twenty sixth of january ninety forty five i was born at hour three bedroom council home the one hitler just managed to miss,1

B00TI6231G,in the next few months i went out with senior photographers learning different skills from each of them recovered a huge variety of work from breaking news to social gatherings and wedding to the weekend market completed his five year apprenticeship as a sign writer atlanta job at the new television broadcaster in newcastle in being channel three he was the anti film cameramen shooting for the evening news so we often turned up at the same event and soon became news rivals gradually with lots of encouragement from my mentors i was getting more appropriate results from my girly shots but it was more yet producing what could be called glamour pictures i was still rather shy meanwhile i found sport pictures boring especially about football the large cameras we used were cumbersome because we had just one lens and the focus was so critical the idea was to set the lens at eight meters and then ran up then sidelined typing for someone to die for a try with lock i could anticipate when this was about to occur an attempt to capture a shot them the mon with luck be in focus i reckon we ran more than the pliers while often wasting lots of film with little to show for it one weekend when covering a football game i left my press camera in the car and use my own thirty five millimeter camera with a long lens attached i captured some great shots and never needed to run around like an idiot the sports editor called me into his office to congratulate me on the head as i was then called into the editor's office he was looking at the back page which featured one of my football shot quite work at the guy me commented casually how did get the ah the usual why running up and down the cylons now you didn't madam i glanced up looking purplish next i was there at the match he said and saw you using your own camera ah well the pictures were good enough i went i yes we already established that but you must use the equipment we supply and not your own understand yes sir but surely it's time to invest in a good thirty five milimiters camera like a nikon with decent set of lenses sorry but the powers that be reckon that quality isn't good enough from a small film or go don't use your own equipment again what a joke the newspaper produced pictures with seventy five little dots of ink to the inch which is vastly inferior to the resolution of thirty five millimeter film still he was the boss so back to running along the sidelines for me grab your gear and get down to the water police was immediately instructed the news editor is a bomb stuck in the harbor dredge i ran running breathlessly and in time to leap onto the police launch seconds before it pulled away from the wharf as we approached the dredge i could say some army personnel moving about on the stern scrambled on board just as a burly sergeant yelled at an hour and gets on our office national intelligence isi and that includes your law he added pointing to a second later journalist and tv cameramen arriving on another launch an unexploded canon show from a japanese submarine which had been fired into the harbor during world war two was now stuck in the section head of the dredge the army disposal experts were studying a manual on how to disarm it then realized that i was the only photographer on board one of the soldiers grabbed the manual and a box of tools and set off to the front of the vessel where the suction his was located my address the sergeant if that thing explodes how much damage will it do quite a lot in fact i don't think any of us will survive without some injury when everyone to stay exactly where they are if that's the case i asked then it wouldn't make much difference where i was wondered perhaps not why with your permission i'd like to get into the suction head with your man and get some photos he started me for just a second giving me the once over to your funeral sunny taken slyly if a corporate doesn't want you there you have to come strive back got it is her to get to the section he had to crawl through a long muddy pipe on the stomach pushing the camera in front of me finally i reached the head which was slightly bigger than the boo have a car a corporal was examining the bomb he looked huge about a meter long and a quarter of a metre in diameter he was caked with rust i asked if i could stay while he designed the shell your death wish or something he asked i would have figured if this thing goes off we're all done for anyway so i might as well do what i get paid for aura but you can't use the flash okay i nodded and took my first shot of him leaning over the deadly cargo and studying the manual eventually he started scribing a wife likes a rush to expose a number stamped on the metal he studied this and referred back to the book it was shockingly hot in the tomb lol the steel section head which hanging out over the water like some giant arm since a child i had suffered from claustrophobia but in the excitement at the moment with adrenaline pumping through my system my fear,1
B00EQA8M3C,on the thirtieth of october nineteen eighteen the ottoman empire agreed to a cessation of hostilities austria hungary followed suit on the third of november then at five am on the morning of the eleventh of november the germans finally agreed to an armistice in a railway carriage parked in a french forest the war was finally over it had lasted for years had involved more than seventy million people and cost the lives of over nine million combatants when news of the armistice broke rudolph was leading his own platoon in long range reconnaissance missions in damascus the german army corps advised him to surrender but rudolph vowed that he would never be captured and was determined to avoid the prisoner of war camps by this time rudolph was a sergeant indeed one of the youngest officers in the army and informed the men in his cavalry platoon about his plans to make it home the band of experienced soldiers mostly in their twenties and thirties immediately swore allegiance to their sixteen year old commander and committed themselves to fighting their way back to germany come what may it took rudolph and his colleagues three months from syria they travelled through turkey where they hitched a ride on a decrepit boat from istanbul across the black sea to the little port of valor in bulgaria from there they headed west and fought against allied troops still active in romania traveling by horse mostly by night to avoid military police and mobs of vigilantes they drove their horses through the deep transylvanian snows and alpine peaks into serbia and then up through hungary and austria before finally reach king mannheim when rudolf arrived back in mannheim however he discovered that everything had changed his mother had succumbed to an unspecified illness a year before on the eighth of april nineteen seventeen dying at the relatively youthful age of thirty seven and his uncle and guardian had sent his sisters to a convent sold the family home and disposed of all of rudolph's personal belongings rudolph was shocked but could hardly be surprised he had been overseas for two years and maintained in frequent contact with his family who fully expected the headstrong youth to embark on a long planned religious career upon his return he was not left destitute the sale of the family house had generated some funds of which a portion had been set aside to support rudolph stay in the seminary such an option should not have been unattractive given the precarious state of germany's postwar economy yet rudolph had no intention of following the family's wishes by becoming a priest the man who rudolf had become during the war didn't have the temperament for study and prayer he walked away from what little inheritance there might have been looking for something more familiar a little later he heard from one of his,0

B00OAODK8G,a lot of times i go into companies that are not performing up to snuff and help them out before i became a turnaround expert and i call myself that was some modesty i ran companies on my own and i found that many of the things that i did could be applied to companies that were in trouble in fact for some reason i seem to always get companies that were in trouble and found myself in the process of digging them out of these troubles and i wanted to pass on this knowledge this information to you to give you an example of the kinds of things i'd have done in the last twenty years i took a company that had been in trouble since it's inception and turned it around and are approximately thirty days turned it from loss to profitability now that doesn't happen with every one of the companies that i do but in this particular instance and i can cite many many examples this company he was struggling to modify it's production processes to make them more efficient because it could not earn anything in terms of its margin and by merely modifying their position in their business in the structure of the way they marketed we were able to completely turn around the business in fact nobody in this particular sector which was highly technical was making any money so in a matter of a few days by changing the philosophy under which they operated we were able to turn this company around i've operated long urge public companies who are loaded with talent and very very bright people but weren't able to see the steps that they had to take to achieve their own salvation so hopefully what you're going to learn throughout this program are some rapid steps to make your key company more profitable and in fact turn it around if you indeed you are in trouble the program is really divided into three phases i'm going to talk to you about quick steps what i call quickies that you can utilize almost immediately to improve cash flow to improve profitability eh i'm going to talk to you about things you can do in terms of finding out what's wrong with your company even though you've been in it for a long time a lot of times you've heard you know you can't see the forest for the trees that's very very true and sometimes you don't realize what your own problems are how to take control of cash almost immediately really one of the big ones i'm gonna talk to you about is pricing and how you may price your product are could be pricing your product at a higher level how you might purchase your components are purchased from your vendors and achieve almost immediate profits from modifying the ways you you've purchase how you can attack receivables to bring the money that's owed you in more rapidly and how you handle people every company has learned how to lay off people how to reduce force but are they doing it the right way i'm going to show you how to do it the right way and how to take control of your expenses these are all quickies and then i'm going to talk to you about medium term kinds of things that you can do how you can analyze your products how you can do a manufacturing analysis to see if you're producing your products are providing your services in the correct way and how you can handle research and development and what is involved in this especially in high tech companies i run low tech high tech all kinds of companies and when i passed this wisdom on to you and finally what i'm going to talk to you about is blows things to take a longer period of time but are well worth it how you can mod modify your market strategy to provide you with long term growth and long term health and viability and how to determine when you should invest in your company all at the same time i'm going to tell you on a parallel path how you can deal with your banks many times if you're in trouble the banks are snapping at your heels your creditors are snapping at your heels i'm going to show you how you can keep these people at bay while you fix your company and then we're going to go back and re-review all of this in a very rapid summary so you remember what to do and how to do it so let's get on with the program the last time i did a series the prophet prescription was in the nineteen eighties the world was in a recession and the u s doubted it's a ability to compete as a manufacturer we thought we were about to become a total service,0

B01ND495VW,you with varied backgrounds and experience to transform their ideas into global billion dollar companies in just a few short years combined with my own experiences at halo this book will also capture the very best thinking experience insight and mistakes from that select group of entrepreneurs who have followed similar billion dollar paths in the mobile world my journey building halo has given me amazing access to some incredible people and has been indispensable in guiding the decisions that will open the gates to the billion dollar app club now i want to share that information with you inside information in writing this book i wanted to draw on advice and insights from only the best companies and the best entrepreneurs while advice from any source can be useful the best and most powerful advice is from those people who have actually achieved billion dollar success in the mobile app world but getting meaningful insight information from entrepreneurs is exceedingly difficult there are two main reasons for this the first is that the people building great mobile businesses today are spending every moment of their time doing just that leaving no time for anything else the second is that many great entrepreneurs but certainly not all are rather coy about sharing too much information about their businesses in case they divulge something that might help their competition gain the upper hand personally i think there's a lot more insight to be gained by actively sharing and soliciting advice than protecting any individual insides i've come across it's hard enough building an average company let alone a billion dollar whoa one what i have sought to understand and distill into this book is what differentiates the truly great companies from run of the mill good companies that focus on the most spectacularly successful apps those that have achieved billion dollar exits or have undisputed valuations at the billion dollar level if you're an android or iphone user then you'll already be an avid user of some more even all of them whatsapp the messaging app viber another messaging app square the payment service angry birds the now ubiquitous game oubre your on-demand chauffeur instagram the social photography app waze the mapping and social traffic app clash of clans the ridiculously popular game from supercell candy crush the sweet game from king snapchat the messaging app where your messages disappear after seconds flipboard third the app based social magazine and tango yet another messaging app this list is growing all the time so for the most up-to-date information visit my billion dollar app dot com while their missions businesses and stories are very different they do share a remarkable number of similarities that have propelled them to great success in this book i focus primarily on mobile first companies ones that have pure mobile dna why because being mobile centric is a different and entirely new way of thinking and is possibly one of the biggest business opportunities in history that being said there are a number of other billion dollar technology startups that began as web sites or even desktop applications there's clearly a huge amount to learn from them not only from the way that they have adapted to the mobile world but also because they are great exam samples of modern companies that have grown from ideas to billion dollar powerhouses by developing better products great leadership constant innovation and above all superb execution companies such as google facebook skype paypal ebay amazon pandora dropbox box go groupon and evernote fall into this category concrete steps the world of mobile technology is exciting and daunting the mobile landscape is constantly changing every week seems to herald the arrival of a new mobile device from smartphones to smart watches to tablets to phablets that's a combination of phone and tablet were also bombarded with new flavors of mobile software androids candy store options include kitkat jelly bean and fro yo apple's ios software is yet different and based on numbers ios eight ios nine and the latest one at the time of writing anyway ios ten seems to adopt a rather candy colored color scheme as well it's all a bit much to keep track of no need to worry though i'll lead you through all the things you need to know part one starts by exploring what has caused technology to become so mobile so quickly and why the biggest most exciting opportunity,0
B07Q4ZSWKM,she pressed her feet into the cement ground through her heels open the door and give it to me i'm tired of waiting are you alone clearly she turned so he could see beyond her and onto the street this was insane but again it seemed so was her brother after the war she pressed her hand to her temple somehow she had to get through to him he needed help as she softened her voice maddox let me in okay fine the jingle and click of metal knobs told her that her brother was working on his half a dozen locks the door open to darkness but then she saw the brown eyes that almost glowed from the sun beaming in the door he wiggled his finger and indicated that she should come in to get the ring she followed the second she was inside he locked all six of his door locks once done he pointed her toward the living room and a gray couch that had seen better decades wait here and i'll find the ring thanks she brushed the goosebumps off her bare arms and stared at the mess in the room medics had papers everywhere and the dust that came from her just walking in told her that he hadn't cleaned in years he stormed down the hall and left her there she refused to even touch that cat couch and moved towards the closest pile of papers the same man's face was on the first half a dozen articles she peered closer and read gable hawk her mind clicked that the hawk name had something to do with computers but she wasn't a techie like her last boyfriend neither was her brother for that matter she walked toward a d different pile but stopped when she coughed on dust at least her brother had made an appearance at the funeral though he had only stayed for half an hour and had deterred the entire time before he served overseas medics never sent chills throughout her body she called out mom would have been happy you came i was always a disappear ointment bored she glanced at the papers on the coffee table again gable hawks name was highlighted as was information about his family he had two sisters and it seemed his parents were close to dying from an assassination attempt her brother doodled stars all over the news clippings the back of her neck grew cold did you find the ring almost good she needed to go then she opened the red folder next to the news articles the folder was like one of the ones they had used in school years ago but inside she saw his handwriting and a print out of an almost dead couple her stomach churned as she picked it up and read close sir she stared so hard at the papers until the words blurred into blackpool's this letter with her brother's name on it couldn't say that her brother had murdered the couple on their way to help at a soup kitchen no that was impossible maddox wasn't that bad he could have written a confession note for a number of reasons why white beads of sweat grew on her forehead in her hands she held her brother's assassination plants the drawing showed where he intended to stand where the old couple went to buy christmas presents and their route to deliver them to needy children at a shelter everything clicked in her head at once the news article had said mister and miss ss hawk were hospitalized and in comas from gunshots near homeless shelter and soup kitchen her heart raced her brother had tried to murder innocent people her hands curled on the folder all those years as a sniper in the marines could mean he was interested in the murder that had his expertise written all over it she stuffed it in her pocket book and then swiped her sweaty palms on her yellow sundress perhaps outside she'd read this differently but right now her breaths became shorter as she edge to the door something fell in the other room and it felt like her heart might stop as she called out she i want you to see a doctor regularly medics doctors can't help me despite how she shivered inside she remembered how she'd promised their mother she do what she could for maddox as she licked her cold lips is there anyone that can i think i put the ring in here give me a moment right the ring her hands shook and she clutched her bag perhaps the schematics were of a football game or anything else and that her mind had made up all those conclusions as she glanced to her right and saw another picture of the hawk family whose gable hook that's an unusual name he ruined my life the stay bateman hung in the air all she could think was that her brother had intended to harm them,0
B076VW267H,part one the values of a nation chapter one the value of values the aim of education is the knowledge not of facts but of values william s burroughs american writer in the past thirty years much has changed in the field of demographic and behavioral marketing significant advances in technology coupled with easy access to data and an ever increasing array of software tools allow marketers to access and analyze customer transaction data in vast quantities and at an amazing rate of speed but it seems reasonable to ask the question are we getting too much measurement and not enough meaning in order to help balance out this quantitative approach to measuring consumers' past behaviors and increase their understanding of why consumers behave the way they do marketers regularly employ age based generational demographics in their marketing strategies this approach is intended to help marketers gain a better understanding of the attitudes and below leafs held by consumers furthermore if these attitudes and beliefs can be understood future behavior can be better predicted and marketing strategies and advertising campaigns can be made more effective interestingly when the current methods used for this approach are closely examined what resonates consistently throughout them is an unstated assumption that consumers' attitudes are best understood by their past behaviors however because behaviors are the results of deep seated and often unconscious values our research strongly suggests that these methods are flawed for marketers to be able to predict future behavior and spot future trends a clear understanding of consumers consistent shared values is required values drive behavior and can act as motivational filters through which the mass of past behavioral data becomes comprehensible and future actions predictable for marketers predictable behavior is what dreams are made of because it allows them to effectively and accurately communicate with target audiences and sell more our products at higher profit margins so if shared values are the holy grail for marketers how can values based groups be uncovered we think it's best done by analyzing significant historical events and cultural icons and defining their impact on the formation of group values this analysis method yields a qualitative yet data-driven ap approach to understanding major and newly defined age based demographic markets and offers an effective way to uncover common tastes and behavioral consistencies within consumer groups what is important to clearly understand is that these new age based groupings or value populations are not based on randomly chosen periods of time time or on the extrapolation of past and current behaviors as are those of the traditionally defined generational groups baby boomers gen x gen y etc value populations as their name implies are groups whose consistent connection is shared values values that were created by experiencing shared events in the cultural the environment we have identified six such groups patriots performers tacticians believers transformers and owls while the second section of this book is devoted entirely to understanding the value populations a brief introduction to their formative periods and a comparison of them to the traditional and generally accepted generational cohort groups is made in figure one one value populations a redefinition of generations during their formative years each value population is presented with unique thematic issues that they will be associated with throughout their collective lifetime in other words whatever value populations collective and seemingly inconsistent behaviors might be there are underlying values that will resonate consistently and continually with them throughout their lifetimes and that explain the seeming inconsistencies because values drive behaviors consistent values allow astute marketers to predict behaviors and increase marketing effectiveness it's this consistency of values that lead us to the title the consistent consumer predicting future behavior through lasting values the foundation of this book is that experiences in our formative years create lasting values that remain consistent over time it is the recognition that every cultural time period produces art artifacts people places and things in a word icons that seal the meaning of a moment in history icons embody all of the values cross trends and cultural currents of the time the essence of the moment when these icons are recognized and analyzed they allow researchers to clearly identify the values people carry with them throughout a lifetime icons offer an amazing plethora of understanding and meaning and as will be shown in the next chapter can be as seemingly inconsequential or so,0

B075SLCB5N,the stone sia the the prologue and so they had his brother too maryland tell us strained against his shackles there was no point to his struggle the oak bindings were as solid as they were crude all he did was sink the metal into his flesh and come close to dislocating his shoulders but the psychic agony of knowing that in another city item early sat had been taken by the orc warlords flagship demanded expression he could howl his desperation or he could pull against the bonds so he struggled he struggled in the painful twisting of his body to push away the despair that closed around his mind he failed the despair was as strong as the oak metal as oppressive as the walls of the underground cave with ellie sat prisoner the orcs whether they knew it or not had taken a great step towards a terrible victory the elder as great fear was coming to pass the humans had withdrawn from what they called the oc terrier system deciding to do nothing more than observe the conflict between the orcs and the pyramids from a distance hoping for mutual annihilation they didn't understand they didn't realize that the only possible outcome of that war was a strengthening of both species as they hone their rage and adaptability on each other for the moment the tide of the war was with the tyrannies the oaks were spilling out of octavius set upon conquering new systems and so they had come to this one there were strategic rationales for them to do so but there was another reason too he prayed that the orcs were unaware of it only he and eli sat knew the full secret of what gift the orcs could find here it was the secret he had come to remove he had seen the danger the same hun had acted the cruiser serpent's strike was faster and more maneuverable than anything the orcs possessed it came to the lapidus system to scour it of the beasts instead it fell to their numbers the overfeed ships came at it relentlessly many died but there were always more and more and more the orcs bordered at multiple points they came straight for him he and his kin fought hard in the image of their ship they killed many of the the invaders like the cruiser they could not kill enough marin tell us could foresee the attacks but they were too many and they were too concerted for advanced knowledge to do any good barricaded on the bridge cornered deprived of the space to deploy with speed the same hon of the serpent's strike made their last stand the orcs took the doors down with high explosives massive brutes in thick armor barreled through the burning entrance the elder cut the first two down but again there were more and behind them something worse it registered upon the skein of time as a dark nomadic tangle moran tell us couldn't get a proper reading on it he couldn't formulate a counter then the bridge filled with fire and shock and it was all too late,0

B077XMY12H,that very little whiskey would be found in the city as by the order of the mayor casks were emptied yesterday evening in the streets and whiskey flowed like water through the gutters but the rabble had managed to find more secretive in the burning shops and bore it away in pitchers and buckets the fire was progressing rapidly and the crashing sound of falling timbers was distinctly heard dr reid's church was blazing the war department was falling down burning papers were being wafted about the streets the commissary department with our desks and papers was const zoomed already warwick and barksdale mall was sending its flames to the sky kerry and main street seemed doomed throughout bank street was beginning to burn almost every house is guarded the moon is shining brightly on our captivity god guide and watch over us richmond was still burning when mrs maguire closed her diary on april third eighteen sixty five was grant coming was it sherman sheridan had damn yankees set the fires many richmond knights heard rumors that they had there were also wild tales about a negro unit of yankee troops sabres drawn marching through the city out to get their former masters there were even rumors that chimborazo hospital the world's largest had been set afire by yankee and cindy aires no one knew what seemed certain was that the remainder of the city would burn to the ground not that much was left of the once supremely proud capital of the confederacy even pride was in short supply there as it often is when food is scarce for ten months richmond and her sister city petersburg had been held under the siege that gave birth to this chaos during the preceding summer alone some eight hundred homes in the area had been damaged by stray shells from the union lines the wolf is at the door here richmond a jack middleton had recently written to his friend the constant diarist mary chesnut in charleston south carolina we dread starvation far more than we do grant or sherman famine that is the word now the wolf had been at richmond's door since about a year before in early eighteen sixty four when general ulysses s grant took charge of all union forces today general robert e lee had begun his hasty retreat along the appomattox river leaving the city defenseless and grant was already hot on his heels far from the streets of richmond apa maddox a word the nation was just beginning to define the river gave it's name to the obscure town it meandered through in south central virginia a sleepy hamlet more properly called appomattox courthouse where all confederate dreams would die epa maddox itself would become a synonym for surrender or for victory or for reconciliation depending on who pronounced it in any case both north and south had been on the road that would end at appomattox ever since president abraham lincoln had conferred the supreme command of all union armies on general ulysses s grant the union's western commander at the time and known as the man of the hour for winning a series of brilliant though blood drenched victories over the past two years general grant would have seemed an unlikely choice for man of the hour at the beginning of the war up until then his life had been mostly a series of disgraces and failures hardly the story book background of a great military hero grant who came from out of what was then the west like most of the union's best generals sherman sheridan thomas had shown little promise outside of his expert horsemanship back when he attended the u s military academy at west point he graduated in the lower half of his eighteen forty three class and drew an infantry assignment rather than a coveted engineer post west point,0
B01MY164YZ,it was early spring and i had been busy all day teaching school and was at home now preparing dinner i knew that david had taken a bike ride after work on one of his favorite mountain trails so i was surprised to hear him come through the garage door earlier than expected hey sweetie you're home early i glanced at the continue to gather ingredients for our meal he walked slowly into the kitchen where i was standing and sat quietly at the table he looked abnormally tired and somewhat perplexed is everything okay i moved closer to the table i just don't understand why my muscles keep twitching he said he was still wearing his snug biking gear so i could see the obvious flickering and jumping that made it appear as if something was alive right under his skin it reminded me of when i was pregnant and saw that tiny movement in my belly from our babies for the first time now it's in my legs too he said his muscles in his arms and shoulders had been twitching for several months now so it was concerning that the flickering had traveled to his legs also i continue to examine his limbs for some sort of answer as to why this was happening i became tired just watching the show that his muscles were performing with all their jumping you know my thumbs have been getting weaker but now i'm also having trouble shifting gears on my bike and gripping the handlebars maybe it's just a pinched nerve or carpal tunnel that we've talked about before i said or perhaps it's just your body's adjustment with your strict diet and the strenuous exercise sighs you've been putting it through you've got the ouachita challenge coming up so you've probably just been pushing your body to it's limit i think it's more he said our kids were in their rooms still waiting for dinner so he began to speak freely i saw dr hammer today in his office dr hammer was a neurologist that had began as a customer of david's that he had now evolved into a dear friend at this remark i sat down next to him him and laid my hand on his arm what did he say i ask hadn't i though all the while that these unusual symptoms were a sign of something simple with a simple fix david wouldn't make eye contact with me he said that after examining me that he felt like i should go to a specialist in houston he said he called my muscle twitching for circulation he said that it could be a handful of things so he wants me to see this other doctor to help figure out what it is what does he think it is i i said i don't know but i think that dr hammer's dad had something similar i have an appointment in houston after my race so i guess we'll find out then i'm sure it's something simple i said as i held him tightly and kissed him on the cheek oh sweetie i love you so much but deep down i think he and i both had this sinking feeling that it was something more something evidently too devastating for david's friend to be the one to deliver over the painful news,1
B071V7CQFK,the photograph was taken in the study of our new york apartment on first glance it is a hallmark tableau of a happy close knit english family abroad fear not though it is anything but the photo is originally intended for a newspaper some old publication whose name i can't remember and for the purposes of artistic composition we the pollens have been arranged children centre forward parents at opposite corners of a linen sofa set against an intellectually abs attract wallpaper that seems very much of it's time quizzical a half smile on his lips my father looks athletic in a grey suit over a pressed shirt his cufflinks are enamel his tie skinny though not overly so dad's hair is better black his skin pale his nose from the jewish side of the family heavily rimmed glasses lend him a bookish if somewhat clark kentish look but this is just so when at home he is the english square a true-blue of eton and oxford went away however and he is often up up and away he is the the superhero of the art world clues to his dual identity the cowboy boots the hair too long for his job the gravitational force of his charm dad is the authoritarian but also the instigator of the sunday morning pillow fight the president of the auction house bunking off work to take us to the movies the aesthete who believes in the majesty of a hot dog breakfast and my mother a somerset maugham beauty whose complexion remains english rose despite growing up under the blistering african sun she wears a necklace of three jade strands and a wraparound jersey dress whose psychedelic print is tastefully muted when she laughs then she's laughing now her eyes crease to happy and her hair riches carib swings under her chin my mother a volunteer teacher in harlem is a hundred percent love and roast chicken picnics in the park she is the draftsman of boundaries the rulemaker the advocates of a prettily said thank you at home where she is almost always to be found she is the answer to every question the entity around which are stratospheric demands orbit custodian of the bedtime story copa secret smoker it is my mother who is the moral backbone of the family then now and forevermore but lo what do we have here perched so coyly on the sofa from behind her eldest child in her patent mary janes so very clean and polished hair black as bagasse complexion clear as water eldest child is serious clever the prism through which every first time parental neuroses has been filtered she is neither smiling nor laughing she is a million emotions away from joy and though we are not done with her not by any means enough of the spotlight on sister susie easy it's time to pay attention to the photos bottom right hand corner where little markers that eminently kissable lampkin of god is straddling a red plastic london bus with the unquestioning delight for public transport that only a four year old can muster apart from his pudding bowl of black hair yes again with the hair color there is nothing noteworthy about youngest child so what's noteworthy about the photograph in the first place you might wonder why the inch by inch scrutiny the worthy discourse here's what's special about this new york hasselblad moment i am i am what special me right there sitting between my parents on the sofa between my parents see how i am the absolute focus of their interest note if you will that this very a second recorded if not for posterity then certainly for the painful longevity of my sibs ling's existence represents the outcome of a desperate and bloody battle in other words it's the happiest moment of my life,1
B00BHQ2M4I,she could hear the last of the thunder rumbling in the distance she could feel it pulsing in the ground beneath her feet as if the earth itself trembled at the storm's fury the forest flickered with lightning strange frightening shapes flashing before her and then vanishing like wraiths the rain had seen ceased long ago but a cool wind swept among the trees carving through her damp clothes chilling her like death she still carried the torch though it offered no light she didn't remember it dying out she should have thrown it away but she couldn't bring herself to let go of it there was comfort to be found and the feel of that rough wood in the faint smell of oil that still lingered in the burned remnants of cloth she should have taken something from the house there were clothes she might need toys she still loved tokens that would help her remember mama and papa chiesa and bade three as if she could forget fear had kept her from going inside she'd gone in once seen that they were dead she hadn't found the courage to go in a second time then mama had died the last of them and she had run from the village was it even a village anymore the houses remained the lanes the marketplace the garden plots but with everyone dead was it still a village a moment later she was crying again how many tears could a girl shed in one night the grief and shame know any limits did fear and rage she didn't know where she was going she knew only that there was none thing left for her here and that she couldn't go to the white hairs again not after what had happened this night she crumpled to the ground overcome once more with anguish she wanted to be sick or to scream or simply to die yes that would have been easiest better death than living with the knowledge of what she had done and what had been done to her there was no one left to mourn her and there was nothing left for her but to mourn the others what kind of life was that she knew that she couldn't take a blade to herself she wasn't brave enough for that but she could throw herself in the wash or could she even that thought made her quail maybe if she went back maybe if she returned to the house and laid herself down beside her dead sisters and her father maybe that would be enough to kill her another gust of wind made her shiver made her teeth chatter perhaps she didn't have to move at all she'd heard of pie people dying in the wild killed by cold and hunger and thirst and wild dogs that could be her but just thinking it made her sit up straight and grip her torch tighter even wanting to die she was too much a coward to do anything but survive she felt that she was betraying those who were gone though mama and papa wouldn't have seen it that way young as she was she knew that much they would tell her to get up to start walking again it doesn't matter where they would say just walk find another village live they were dead because of her the taste of failure in her mouth was enough to make her gag it wasn't just me she said aloud angry hurt desperate to believe it it's their fault too may be even more than mine then why did you lie to mama i didn't mean to lie she whispered tears streaking her face lightning flashed overhead illuminating the wood and making her flinch pale faces seemed to loom among the trees watching her laughing she covered her ears and closed her eyes eyes but it was several moments before the thunder finally rumbled it's answer eventually she opened her eyes again and her hands dropped to her side she sat there for what seemed a long time lightening lit the forest several times more and still the thunder retreated no more rain fell even the storm was leaving her now she wanted to lie down and close her eyes and never wake again but as frightened as she was of being alone death scared her more eventually she climbed to her feet and still gripping that dead torch she started down the path once more yes walk the voices said urging her on find another village live,0
B0106NITQW,i came into this world as no the mod claiborne and eighteen ninety two and perkins fail in the northwest corner of tennessee a few miles west of dyersburg pinned to the ground by a church spire at each end of the road that cut the town in half perkins ville was barely a wide space in the road the houses were so far apart it was almost country who was made up of mostly farmers and the businesses that serve them most of the houses had a barn in the back for one or two horses and a buggy to ride in or a wagon for farm work we all had chickens and a cow for milk every house had a vegetable garden and most of them had some sort of orchard with apple cherry and pear trees there was one general store and one doctor a widow in town sometimes rented out sleeping rooms to travelers but there was no hotel no restaurant no bank and certainly no saloon almost everyone still raise their own chickens hogs fruits and vegetables i remember it partly by it smells walking through town in the winter i could smell the smoke from the wood burning fireplaces and stoves the farm animals and if the wind was right the stink of the chicken coops in spring the air was heavy with the sweetness of fruit blossoms and freshly turned soil there was a baptist church to the east and and a holiness church to the west my family was holiness and our lives revolved around our church we went to meetings sunday morning sunday night and wednesday night once a year there would be a visiting preacher and a revival that will go on every evening for a week the steeples of the two churches served as a sort of city limits you could walk from one church to the other in less than a half hour there were no catholics and no jews and most of us didn't even know that there was any such thing as an atheist not one person there would even have understood what any atheist was except maybe the doctor he had more education than most and had lived in other places until he was in his sixties when his wife died and he gave up his practice in the city to come back to live where he grew up most folks in my town were born there and died there and maybe took one trip to memphis on their honeymoon there were some colored folk too but they live down the road a short distance from the larger part of town in looks i took after my father charles eugene clay born with straight brown hair and brown eyes i was big for my age and built sturdy like my daddy my sister helen was eleven years older and took after our mother faith they were both small and trim daddy used to say they were as big as a minute they were fair with sparkling blue eyes and hair of a pale blonde shade helen's hair hung in waves over her shoulders but mama wore hers pinned up in a bun at the back of her neck the way all the married women did i love the way little wisp of curls would escape the pins when mama was outside they would flutter in the breeze like butterflies dancing on her neck helen had an hourglass figure and the neighbors used to say that she had a waste a man could clasp his hands around those ladies would smile kindly at me and pat me on the head as if to comfort me i hated that i knew early on that i was playing i got used to it my mother fussed over helen all the time making her pretty dresses tie ribbons in her hair other than telling me what to do she didn't pay me any mind it didn't really bother me all that much i was a daddy's girl he ran the livery stable across the street from our little house he trained a few horses to sell rent it out horses and buggies and boarded travelers mounts he was up and gone to tend the stock before i got out of bed in the morning when he came home for dinner he would give mama kiss and then scoop me up in his strong arms give me a big hug then he'd sit me on his knee and talk to me just me,1
B079SRM1Z6,here they come six wolves poked their heads out from between trees the one in the lead snarled my heart thumped they were not like normal wolves those wolves typically ran from humans and had very little terrain left entire subspecies had been wiped doubt during the last thirty years continue one lines wolves were bulky muscled creatures with jaws dripping rivers of saliva they moved in unison straight for us dirt and roots chipped as their bodies surged across the forest months of frequent virtual reality combat helped me know how to hack handle this i pulled out more goos echo and whipped the spear shaped forward it barely completed transforming before excessive amounts of braun sped it rapidly along the lead wolves dodged and a third went flying as the spear impaled upon a tree trunk one down i swung more a goose gift in it's two handed form the blade rippled into shape barely before my blink went off placing me in front of the ones charging for beth the remainder of my partially completed swing lined up perfectly with a wolf's face and obsidian black edge sliced through the open jaw and carved a path along the beast's body to down my gaze turned toward beth another slice of light formed across the air as beth's forehead drip btw with sweat the biggest wolf veered straight for thorny as her in-game character was called her clothes wouldn't stand up against the monstrous teeth and another one was headed for her blinks cooldown needed a few more seconds voices damnit dust could have taken one i cursed transferred more goose gift over to one hand recalled then lifted my other weapon for a throw the shot sliced a bit of fur and made the running beast turned toward me with a saliva filled snarl paws caught my backside i kicked with one foot then twisted teeth tore into my arm as the metallic sound of power armor expanding from my laces could be heard the toga went stiff and expanded wild bill's brim folded down into part of the helmet a jaw released to snap at me again and and yelped as my tender flesh turned to something like a knight's armor i still only had a vague idea of what this ability looked like outside the suit tails mingled badly with fur and a sliver of vision my armor was being chewed on along with bits of health where teeth poked through wolves piled onto me beth's chanting finished and my niece snapped the sword toward her other hand holding it in front like a baton incoming bombardment beth shouted while pushing forth the lithium formula carved into the air light pulsed from the carvings and i lifted my arm to avoid being blinded from the formation a wall of small light balls flew out rapidly energy of all colors trailed behind them as they rapidly sought out targets a wolf yelped and the pressure on top of me dropped away my own abilities were only a portion of their original amount i lay flat and looked around as much as the armor would allow me for more bolts hit other wolves my hand swung more goose gift into the wolf if that had been knocked off of me but it didn't go far a crunching sound preceded the creatures abrupt yelp after a mess of orbs flew out they stopped i stood quickly then looked around for a target to blink toward and kill are you okay beth asked they were all dead six wolves and i had only defeated three of them convict brands partial reduction might account for some of that my niece a sword carrying maids of some sort had destroyed the others with one spell two wolves show scorch marks the third had frozen with a bit of melted green for ah i said while trying to evaluate the damage even tinker hell hadn't been this effective that friendly woman had done ice bolts and walls but not a heat seeking multiple elements spell voices that's neat,0
